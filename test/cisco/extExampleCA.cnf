#
# This config file used as an Ugly Simple CA for EST demonstration purposes
#
# Normally one would replace the ESTserver callout scripts with scripts that 
# talk to your own fully armed and operational CA. (e.g. something real with some
# meat behind it, not just some demo CA).
#
# This particular config file mostly used as an "external" CA.
# It stands in for an alternate PKI that might have issued an existing
# client certificate. An alternate example is to issue a certificate
# to the estserver which is NOT issued by the CA the estserver fronts
# for. This would be equivalent to an estserver with a certificate
# issued by a web server CA but fronting for a local CA.
