<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of 
cryptographic algorithms.  The package is organised so that it 
contains a light-weight API suitable for use in any environment
(including the newly released J2ME) with the additional infrastructure
to conform the algorithms to the JCE framework.
</p>
<h2>2.0 Release History</h2>

<h3>2.1.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.50
<h3>2.1.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The DualECSP800DRBG sometimes truncated the last block in the generated stream incorrectly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Keys produced from RSA certificates with specialised parameters would lose the parameter settings. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>OAEP parameters were being ignored on CMS key trans recipient processing. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>OpenPGP NotationData was restricting the name and value lengths to 255 characters and truncating silently. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>CTS mode is now in alignment with the errata for RFC 2040, as detailed in RFC 3962.</li>
<li>Occasionally the provider implementation of DH KeyAgreement would drop a leading zero byte off the start of the shared secret (see RFC 2631 2.1.2). This has been fixed.</li>
<li>RFC3394WrapEngine was ignoring the offset parameter inOff and using zero instead. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>GOST keys would not encode using the CryptoPro parameter set, even if it was available. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The TimeStampRequest stream constructor was not setting the extensions field correctly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Default RC2 parameters for 40 bit RC2 keys in CMSEnvelopedData were encoding incorrectly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>In case of a long hash the DSTU4145 implementation would sometimes remove one bit too much during truncation. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.1.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Additional work has been done on CMS recipient generation to simplify the generation of OAEP encrypted messages and allow for non-default parameters.</li>
<li>OCB implementation updated to account for changes in draft-irtf-cfrg-ocb-03.</li>
<li>RFC 6637 ECDSA and ECDH support has been added to the OpenPGP API.</li>
<li>Implementations of Threefish and Skein have been added to the provider and the lightweight API.</li>
<li>Implementations of the SM3 digest have been added to the provider and the lightweight API.</li>
<li>The 3 MAC based KDF generators in NIST SP 800-108 have been added to the lightweight API.</li>
<li>Support has been added for the GOST PKCS#5 PBKDF2 PBE function and handling of GOST PKCS#12 files.</li>
<li>Support has been added for the CryptoPro GOST CFB mode key meshing.</li>
<li>Implementations of XSalsa20 and ChaCha have been added. Support for reduced round Salas20 has been added.</li>

<li>OpenSSL JcaPEMKeyConverter now supports OIDs for RSA and DSA as well as ECDSA.</li>
<li>A simplified certificate path API has been added to the PKIX package. It is not fully NIST compliant yet, however it does provide a range of basic validations without having to use the JCA.</li>
<li>Package version inforamation is now included in the jar MANIFEST.MF.</li>
<li>The JDK 1.5+ provider will now recognise and use GCMParameterSpec if it is run in a 1.7 JVM.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.1.4 Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>org.bouncycastle.crypto.DerivationFunction is now a base interface, the getDigest() method appears on DigestDerivationFunction.</li>
<li>Recent developments at NIST indicate the SHA-3 may be changed before final standardisation. Please bare this in mind if you are using it.</li>
<li>Other recent developments have raised concerns about the DualECDRGB. We have left the class in place for now, but it is now possible to provide your own parameter values, rather than using the NIST defined ones, if you choose to do so.</li>
<li>Most deprecated methods have been removed from the PKIX API.</li>
<li>As the IDEA patent has finally expired, IDEA is now supported by the standard provider.</li>
<li>ECDH support for OpenPGP should still be regarded as experimental. It is still possible there will be compliance issues with other implementations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.49
<h3>2.2.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Occasional ArrayOutOfBounds exception in DSTU-4145 signature generation has been fixed.</li>
<li>The handling of escaped characters in X500 names is much improved.</li>
<li>The BC CertificateFactory no longer returns null for CertificateFactory.getCertPathEncodings().</li>
<li>PKCS10CertificationRequestBuilder now encodes no attributes as empty by default. Encoding as absent is still available via a boolean flag.</li>

<li>OAEPEncoding could throw an array output bounds exception for small keys with large mask function digests. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>PEMParser would throw a NullPointerException if it ran into explicit EC curve parameters, it would also throw an Exception if the named curve was not already defined. The parser now returns X9ECParmameters for explicit parameters and returns an ASN1ObjectIdentifier for a named curve.</li>
<li>The V2TBSCertListGenerator was adding the wrong date type for CRL invalidity date extensions. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>

class NonMemoableDigest has been added which hides the Memoable interface where it should not be available.</li>
<li>TDEA is now recognised as an alias for DESede.</li>
<li>A new package org.bouncycastle.crypto.ec has been introduced to the light wieght API with a range of EC based cryptographic operators.</li>

<h3>2.2.4 Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The NTRU implementation has been moved into the org.bouncycastle.pqc package hierarchy.</li>
<li>The change to PEMParser to support explicit EC curves is not backward compatible. If you run into a named curve you need to use org.bouncycastle.asn1.x9.ECNamedCurveTable.getByOID() to look the curve up if required.</li>

</ul>

<h3>2.4.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.47
<h3>2.4.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>OpenPGP ID based certifications now support UTF-8. Note: this may mean that some old certifications no longer validate - if this happens a retry can be added using by converting the ID using Strings.fromByteArray(Strings.toByteArray(id)) - this will strip out the top byte in each character.</li>

</ul>

<h3>2.4.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>

<li>The J2ME lcrypto release now includes higher level classes for handling PKCS, CMS, CRMF, CMP, EAC, OpenPGP, and certificate generation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4.4 Other notes</h3>
<p>
Okay, so we have had to do another release. The issue we have run into is that we probably didn't go far enough in 1.46, but we are now confident that moving from this release to 2.0 should be largely just getting rid of deprecated methods. While this release does change a lot it is relatively straight forward to do a port and we have a <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/display/JA1/Porting+from+earlier+BC+releases+to+1.47+and+later">porting guide</a> which explains the important ones. The area there has been the most change in is the ASN.1 library which was in bad need of a rewrite after 10 years of patching. On the bright side the rewrite did allow us to eliminate a few problems and bugs in the ASN.1 library, so we have some hope anyone porting to it will also have similar benefits. As with 1.46 the other point of emphasis has been making sure interface support is available for operations across the major APIs, so the lightweight API or some local role your own methods can be used instead for doing encryption and signing.
</p>

<h3>2.5.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.46
<h3>2.5.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>An edge condition in ECDSA which could result in an invalid signature has been fixed.</li>
<li>Exhaustive testing has been performed on the ASN.1 parser, eliminating another potential OutOfMemoryException and several escaping run time exceptions.</li>
<li>BC generated certificates generated different hashCodes from other equivalent implementations. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Parsing an ESSCertIDv2 would fail if the object did not include an IssuerSerialNumber. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>DERGeneralizedTime.getDate() would produce incorrect results for fractional seconds. This has been fixed.</li>

<ul>
<li>A null genTime can be passed to TimeStampResponseGenerator.generate() to generate timeNotAvailable error responses.</li>
<li>Support has been added for reading and writing of openssl PKCS#8 encrypted keys.</li>
<li>New streams have been added for supporting general creation of PEM data, and allowing for estimation of output size on generation. Generators have been added for some of the standard OpenSSL objects.</li>
<li>CRL searching for CertPath validation now supports the optional algorithm given in Section 6.3.3 of RFC 5280, allowing the latest CRL to be used for a set time providing the certificate is unexpired.</li>

</ul>
<h3>2.5.4 Other notes</h3>
<p>
Baring security patches we expect 1.46 will be the last of the 1.* releases. The next release of
BC will be version 2.0. For this reason a lot of things in 1.46 that relate to CMS have been deprecated and
new methods have been added to the CMS and certificate handling APIs which provide greater flexibility
in how digest and signature algorithms get used. It is now possible to use the lightweight API or a simple
custom API with CMS and for certificate generation. In addition a lot of methods and some classes that were
deprecated for reasons of been confusing, or in some cases just plan wrong, have been removed. 
</p>
<p>
So there are four things useful to know about this release:
<ul>
<li>It's not a simple drop in like previous releases, if you wish migrate to it you will need to recompile your application.</li>
<li>If you avoid deprecated methods it should be relatively painless to move to version 2.0</li>
<li>The X509Name class will utlimately be replacde with the X500Name class, the getInstance() methods on both these classes allow conversion from one type to another.</li>
<li>The org.bouncycastle.cms.RecipientId class now has a collection of subclasses to allow for more specific recipient matching. If you are creating your own recipient ids you should use the constructors for the subclasses rather than relying on the set methods inherited from X509CertSelector. The dependencies on X509CertSelector and CertStore will be removed from the version 2 CMS API.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>2.6.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.45
<h3>2.6.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>OpenPGP now supports UTF-8 in file names for literal data.</li>
<li>The ASN.1 library was losing track of the stream limit in a couple of places, leading to the potential of an OutOfMemoryError on a badly corrupted stream. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The provider now uses a privileged block for initialisation.</li>
<li>JCE/JCA EC keys are now serialisable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.6.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for EC MQV has been added to the light weight API, provider, and the CMS/SMIME library.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.6.4 Security Advisory</h3>
<ul>
<li>This version of the provider has been specifically reviewed to eliminate possible timing attacks on algorithms such as GCM and CCM mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.7.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.44
<h3>2.7.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The reset() method in BufferedAsymmetricBlockCipher is now fully clearing the buffer.</li>
<li>Use of ImplicitlyCA with KeyFactory and Sun keyspec no longer causes NullPointerException.</li>
<li>X509DefaultEntryConverter was not recognising telephone number as a PrintableString field. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The SecureRandom in the J2ME was not using a common seed source, which made cross seeeding of SecureRandom's impossible. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Occasional uses of "private final" on methods were causing issues with some J2ME platforms. The use of "private final" on methods has been removed.</li>
<li>NONEwithDSA was not resetting correctly on verify() or sign(). This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Fractional seconds in a GeneralisedTime were resulting in incorrect date conversions if more than 3 decimal places were included due to the Java date parser. Fractional seconds are now truncated to 3 decimal places on conversion.</li>
<li>The micAlg in S/MIME signed messages was not always including the hash algorithm for previous signers. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>SignedMailValidator was only including the From header and ignoring the Sender header in validating the email address. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The PKCS#12 keystore would throw a NullPointerException if a null password was passed in. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>CertRepMessage.getResponse() was attempting to return the wrong underlying field in the structure. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>PKIXCertPathReviewer.getTrustAnchor() could occasionally cause a null pointer exception or an exception due to conflicting trust anchors. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Handling of explicit CommandMap objects with the generation of S/MIME messages has been improved.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.7.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>PEMReader/PEMWriter now support encrypted EC keys.</li>
<li>BC generated EC private keys now include optional fields required by OpenSSL.</li>
<li>Support for PSS signatures has been added to CMS and S/MIME.</li>
<li>CMS processing will attempt to recover if there is no AlgorithmParameters object for a provider and use an IvParameterSpec where possible.</li>
<li>CertificateID always required a provider to be explicitly set. A null provider is now interpreted as a request to use the default provider.</li>
<li>SubjectKeyIdentifier now supports both methods specified in RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.2 for generating the identifier.</li>
<li>Performance of GCM mode has been greatly improved (on average 10x).</li>
<li>The BC provider has been updated to support the JSSE in providing ECDH.</li>

<li>X509Name.hashCode() is now consistent with equals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.8.3 Security Advisory</h3>
<ul>
<li>The effect of the sign extension bug was to decrease the key space the HC-128 and HC-256 ciphers were operating in and the byte swapping inverted every 32 bits of the generated stream. If you are using either HC-128 or HC-256 you must upgrade to this release.</li>
</ul>

Release 1.42
<h3>2.9.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>

a JCE interface with the same method signature.
<li>org.bouncycastle.jce.interfaces.ECKey.getParams() has been changed in JDK 1.5 to getParameters() to avoid clashes
with a JCE interface with the same method signature. The getParams() method in pre-1.5 has been deprecated.
<li>SHA256WithRSAEncryption, SHA384WithRSAEncryption, SHA512WithRSAEncryption now refer to their PKCS #1 V1.5 implementations. If you
were using these previously you should use SHA256WithRSAAndMGF1, SHA384WithRSAAndMGF1, or SHA512WithRSAAndMGF1.

    because policymapping, name and subtree constraints are not yet
    implemented.
    <li>The API now supports the generation of PKCS7 signed objects. Note: this

Release 1.12
<h3>2.39.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The ASN.1 library was unable to read an empty set object. This has been fixed.
    <li>Returning sets of critical and non-critical extensions on X.509 certificates could result in a null pointer exception if the certificate had no extensions. This has been fixed.

length less than 2 on calling the getCertificateChain method. This has been
fixed.
<li>Lone certificates were not been stored in the PKCS12 store. This has been fixed.

block size of the cipher if the mode was reused with a shorter IV. This has
been fixed.

DER-Encoded octet string not the DER-Encoded octet string as required. This has
been fixed.
<li>reset on the version 3 X.509 certificate generator was not flushing the
extensions. This has been fixed.
<li>The NetscapeCert type bits were reversed! This has been fixed.

compressed ones.
</ul>
<h3>2.40.4 Other changes</h3>

has been fixed.
<li>The ASN.1 input streams now handle zero-tagged zero length objects correctly.
</ul>
<h3>2.41.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>The JCE Provider and the lightweight API now support Serpent, CAST5, and CAST6.
<li>The JCE provider and the lightweight API now has an implementation of ECIES.
<b>Note:</b> this is based on a draft, don't use it for anything that needs to
be kept long term as it may be adjusted.
<li>Further work has been done on performance - mainly in the symmetric ciphers.
<li>Support for the generation of PKCS10 certification requests has been added.
</ul>
<h3>2.42.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.09
<h3>2.42.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>failure to pass in an RC5 parameters object now results in an exception
at the upper level of the JCE, rather than falling over in the lightweight
library.
<li>ISO10126Padding now incorporates the correct amount of random data.
<li>The PKCS12 key store wasn't picking up certificate chains properly
when being used to write PKCS12 files. This has been fixed.
<li>The Twofish engine would call System.exit if the key was too large.
This has been fixed.
<li>In some cases the ASN.1 library wouldn't handle implicit tagging properly.
This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.42.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for RC5-64 has been added to the JCE.
<li>ISO9796-2 signatures have been added to the JCE and lightweight API.
<li>A more general paddings packge for use with MACs and block ciphers had been aded to the lightweight API. MACs now allow you to specify padding.
<li>X9.23 Padding has been added to the JCE and lightwieght API. The old
PaddedBlockCipher class is now deprecated see org.bouncycastle.crypto.paddings for details.
<li>SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 are now added. Note: while the public review
period has finished, these algorithms have not yet been standardised, in the
event that final standardisation changes the algorithms these implementations
will be changed.
<li>It's now possible to set bag attributes on items to go into a PKCS12 store,
using the org.bouncycastle.jce.interfaces.PKCS12BagAttributeCarrier interface.
<li>More classses have been added to the ASN.1 package for dealing with
certificate extensions and CRLs including a CRL generator. Note: the
CRL generators should be regarded as under development and subject to change.
<li>There's now an examples package for the JCE (in addition to the examples
in org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.test) - org.bouncycastle.jce.examples. It
currently consists of a class showing how to generate a PKCS12 file.
<li>The X.509 CertificateFactory now includes CRL support.  DER or PEM CRLs may be processed.
<li>The BigInteger library has been written with a view to making it less
resource hungry and faster - whether it's fast enough remains to be seen!
</ul>

<h3>2.43.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.08

<h3>2.43.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>It wasn't possible to specify an ordering for distinguished names in
X509 certificates. This is now supported.
<li>In some circumstances stream Ciphers in the JCE would cause null pointer
exceptions on doFinal. This has been fixed.
<li>Unpadded ciphers would sometimes buffer the last block of input, even
if it could be processed. This has been fixed.
<li>The netscape certificate request class wouldn't compile under JDK 1.1. This
has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.43.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>ISO 9796-1 padding is now supported with RSA in the lightweight
API and the JCE.
<li>support classes have been added for reading and writing PKCS 12 files,
including a keystore for the JCA.
<li>The message digests MD4, Tiger, and RIPEMD128 have been added to the
JCE and the lightweight API. Note: MD4 and RIPEMD128 have been added for
compatibility purposes only - we recommend you don't use them for anything new!
<li>The JDK 1.1 certificate classes didn't conform to the JDK 1.2 API as
the collections class was not present. Thanks to a donated collections API
this is fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.44.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.07

<h3>2.44.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>It turned out that the setOddParity method in the DESParameter class
was indeed doing something odd but not what was intended. This is now
fixed. <b>Note:</b>This will affect some PBE encryptions that were carried
out with DES, equivalent PBE ciphers to the old PBE DES cipher can be
accessed by prepending the work "Broken" in front of the original PBE cipher
call. If you want an example of how to deal with this as a migration issue
have a look in org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JDKKeyStore lines 201-291.
</ul>
<h3>2.45.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.06

<h3>2.45.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Diffie-Hellman keys are now properly serialisable as well as
encodable.
<li>Three of the semi-weak keys in the DESParameters, and the DESKeySpec look
up table, were incorrect. This has been fixed.
<li>DESEDE key generators now accept 112 and 168 as the key sizes, as well
as 128 and 192 (for those people who don't like to count the parity bits).
<li>Providing no strength parameter is passed to the DESede key generator in
the JCE provider, the provider now generates DESede keys in the k1-k2-k1
format (which is compatible with the Sun reference implementation), otherwise
you get what you ask for (3-DES or 2-DES in the minimum number of bytes).
<li>Base Diffie-Hellman key agreement now works correctly for more than two
parties.
<li>Cipher.getAlgorithmParameters was returing null in cases where a cipher
object had generated it's own IV. This has been fixed.
<li>An error in the key store occasionally caused checks of entry types to
result in a null pointer exception. This has been fixed.
<li>RSA key generator in JCE now recognises RSAKeyGenerationParameterSpec.
<li>Resetting and resusing HMacs in the lightweight and heavyweight libraries
caused a NullPointer exception. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.45.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>ISO10126Padding is now recognised explicitly for block ciphers
as well.
<li>The Blowfish implementation is now somewhat faster.
</ul>

<h3>2.46.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.05

<h3>2.46.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The DESEDE key generator can now be used to generate 2-Key-DESEDE
keys as well as 3-Key-DESEDE keys.
<li>One of the weak keys in the DESParameters, and the DESKeySpec look
up table, was incorrect. This has been fixed.
<li>The PKCS12 generator was only generating the first 128-160 bits of the
key correctly (depending on the digest used). This has been fixed.
<li>The ASN.1 library was skipping explicitly tagged objects of zero length.
This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.46.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is now an org.bouncycastle.jce.netscape package which has
a class in for dealing with Netscape Certificate Request objects.
</ul>
<h3>2.46.4 Additional Notes</h3>
<p>
Concerning the PKCS12 fix: in a few cases this may cause some backward
compatibility issues - if this happens to you, drop us a line at
<a href="mailto:feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org">feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org</a>
and we will help you get it sorted out.

<h3>2.47.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.04

<h3>2.47.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Signatures generated by other providers that include optional null
parameters in the AlgorithmIdentifier are now handled correctly by the
provider.
<li>The JCE 1.2.1 states that the names of algorithms associated with the JCE
are case insensitive. The class that matches algorithms to names now tries
to match the name given with it's equivalent in upper case, before trying
to match it as given. If you write a provider and include versions of your
algorithm names in uppercase only, this JCE implementation will always
match a getInstance regardless of the case of the algorithm passed into
the getInstance method.
<li>If the JCE API and the Provider were in a different class path, the
class loader being used sometimes failed to find classes for JCE Ciphers, etc.
This has been fixed.
<li>An error in the ASN.1 library was causing problems serialising Diffie-Hellman keys. This has been fixed.
<li>The agreement package was left out of the j2me bat file. This has been fixed.
<li>The BigInteger class for 1.0 and the j2me wasn't able to generate random
integers (prime or otherwise). This has been fixed. 
<li>The BigInteger class would sometimes go into a death spiral if the any
32nd bit of an exponent was set when modPow was called. This has been fixed. 
<li>Cipher.getInstance would treat "//" in a transformation as a single "/".
This has been fixed.
<li>PBEWithSHAAndIDEA-CBC was throwing an exception on initialisation. This has
been fixed.
<li>The X509Name class in the asn1.x509 package wasn't initialising its local
hash table when the hash table constructor was called. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.47.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added Elliptic Curve DSA (X9.62) - ECDSA - to provider and lightweight
library.
<li>Added Elliptic Curve basic Diffie-Hellman to provider and lightweight
library.
<li>Added DSA support to the provider and the lightweight library.
<li>Added super class interfaces for basic Diffie-Hellman agreement classes
to lightweight library.
<li>The certificate generators now support ECDSA and DSA certs as well.
</ul>

<h3>2.48.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.03

<h3>2.48.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>CFB and OFB modes when specified without padding would insist on input
being block aligned. When specified without padding CFB and OFB now behave in a compatible 
fashion (a doFinal on a partial block will yield just the data that could
be processed).
In short, it provides another way of generating cipher text the same
length as the plain text.
</ul>

<h3>2.49.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.02

<h3>2.49.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RSA key pair generator occasionally produced keys 1 bit under the
requested size. This is now fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.50.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.01

<h3>2.50.2 Defects Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Buffered ciphers in lightweight library were not resetting correctly
on a doFinal. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.51.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.0 

<h3>2.51.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>JDK1.2 version now works with keytool for certificate generation.
<li>Certificate toString method no longer throws a null pointer exception
if a group [3] extension has not been added.
<li>Under some circumstances the NullCipher would throw a NullPointerException,
this has been fixed.
<li>Under some circumstances CipherInputStream would throw a NullPointerException, this has been fixed.
<li>OpenSSL/SSLeay private key encodings would cause an exception to be thrown
by the RSA key factory. This is now fixed.
<li>The Cipher class always used the default provider even when one was specified, this has been fixed.
<li>Some DES PBE algorithms did not set the parity correctly in generated keys, this has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.51.3 Additional functionality</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Argument validation is much improved.
<li>An X509KeyUsage class has been added to the JCE class to make it easier
to specify the KeyUsage extension on X.509 certificates.
<li>The library now allows creation of version 1 certificates as well.
</ul>

<h3>3.0 Notes</h3>
<p>
The J2ME is only supported under Windows.
<p>
If you are trying to use the lightweight provider in a JDK 1.0 applet, you
need to change the package names for java.math.BigInteger, java.lang.IllegalStateException, and java.security.SecureRandom
<p>
The RSA test under JDK 1.0 and J2ME takes a while to run...
