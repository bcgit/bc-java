<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of 
cryptographic algorithms.  The package is organised so that it 
contains a light-weight API suitable for use in any environment
(including the J2ME) with the additional infrastructure
to conform the algorithms to the JCE framework.
</p>

<h3>2.2.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>NewHope and SPHINCS keys are now correctly created off certificates by the BC provider.</li>
<li>Use of the seeded constructor with SecureRandom() and the BC provider in first position could cause a stack overflow error. This has been fixed.</li>

<h3>2.3.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.57 <br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2017, May 11
<h3>2.3.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>A class cast exception for master certification removal in PGPPublicKey.removeCertification() by certification has been fixed.</li>
<li>GOST GOFB 28147-89 mode had an edge condition concerning the incorrect calculation of N4 (see section 6.1 of RFC 5830) affecting about 1% of IVs. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The X.509 PolicyConstraints class was using implicit rather than explicit tagging for the SkipCerts field. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Key expiration in the OpenPGP is now calculated for ambiguous self signatures using the most recently created self-signature, in line with GPG and the recommendation in RFC 4880.</li>
<li>Multiple validity periods in PGP keys were resolved in an adhoc fashion, in line with GPG's approach the PGP has been changed to return the most recent validity period signed.</li>
<li>An occasional class cast exception that could occur with nested multi-parts in the S/MIME API has been fixed.</li>
<li>A couple of bogus aliases associated AlgorithmParameters that did not resolve in the provider have been removed.</li>
<li>The CMS API will now correctly verify PSS signatures with odd length salts.</li>
<li>Choosing an invalid mode on a stream cipher in the JCE could result in an IllegalArgumentException. This has now been corrected to throw a NoSuchAlgorithmException.</li>
<li>Optional parameters for ECDSA public keys in CVCertificates were hard coded to non-optional. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Passing a PKCS12 key to a Mac in the BC JCE always resulted in SHA-1 being used to process the password regardless of the underlying MAC algorithm. This has been fixed. An unrecognised HMAC will also now result in an exception.</li>
<li>The Base64 encoder now explicitly validates 2 character padding as being "==".</li>
<li>EC FixedPointCombMultiplier avoids 'infinity' point in lookup tables, reducing timing side-channels.</li>
<li>Reuse of a Blake2b digest with a call to reset() rather than doFinal() could result in incorrect padding being introduced and the wrong digest result produced. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.3.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>ARIA (RFC 5794) is now supported by the provider and the lightweight API.</li>
<li>ARIA Key Wrapping (RFC 5649 style) is now supported by the provider and the lightweight API.</li>
<li>SM2 signatures, key exchange, and public key encryption has been added to the lightweight API.</li>
<li>XMSS has been added to the lightweight PQ API. Note: this should be treated as beta code.</li>
<li>API support for client side EST (RFC 7030), as well as some CMC (RFC 5273) has been added to the PKIX API. A full set of ASN.1 classes for both protocols has been added as well.</li>
<li>A test client for EST which will interop with the 7030 test server at http://testrfc7030.com/ has been added to the general test module in the current source tree.</li>
<li>The BCJSSE provider now supports SSLContext.getDefault(), with very similar behaviour to the SunJSSE provider, including checks of the relevant javax.net.ssl.* system properties and auto-loading of jssecacerts or cacerts as the default trust store.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.3.4 Security Related Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The default parameter sizes for DH and DSA are now 2048. If you have been relying on key pair generation without passing in parameters generated keys will now be larger.</li>
<li>Further work has been done on preventing accidental re-use of a GCM cipher without first changing its key or iv.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.56 <br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2016, December 23
<h3>2.4.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>See section 2.1.4 for Security Defects.</li>
<li>Using unknown status with the ASN.1 CertStatus primitive could result in an IllegalArgumentException on construction. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>A potentional NullPointerException in a precomputation in WNafUtil has been removed.</li>
<li>PGPUtil.getDecoderStream() would throw something other than an IOException for empty and very small data. This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.4.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for the explicit setting of AlgorithmParameters has been added to the JceCMSContentEncryptorBuilder and the JceCMSMacCaculatorBuilder classes to allow configuration of the session cipher/MAC used.</li>
<li>EC, ECGOST3410, and DSTU4145 Public keys are now validated on construction in the JCA/JCE and the light weight API.</li>
<li>DSA Public keys are now validated on construction in the JCA/JCE and the light weight API.</li>
<li>Diffie-Hellman public keys are now validated where parameters allow it.</li>
<li>Some validations are now applied to RSA moduli and public exponents.</li>
<li>The ASN.1 Object Identifier cache now uses a Concurrent HashMap for additional speed.</li>
<li>AES-CCM MAC support has been added to the provider.</li>
<li>Support for ChaCha7539 (ChaCha20 as defined in RFC 7539) and Poly1305 have been added to the provider.</li>
<li>Support has been added for defining your own curves and making them available to the key generators and factories.</li>
<li>Methods have been added for specifying that a PGPPublicKey/PGPPublicKeyRing is being encoded for export and trust packets are not required.</li>
<li>Plain-ECDSA and SHA-3 support has been added to DefaultDigestAlgorithmIdentifierFinder.</li>
<li>SHA-3 support has been added to BcDefaultDigestProvider.</li>
<li>A higher level TLS API and JSSE provider have been added to the project.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.4.4 Security Related Changes and CVE's Addressed by this Release</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to configure the provider to only import keys for specific named curves.</li>
<li>Work has been done to improve the "constant time" behaviour of the RSA padding mechanisms.</li>
<li>The GCM ciphers in the JCE and lightweight API will now fail if an attempt is made to use them for encryption after a doFinal or without changing the IV.</li>
<li>The constructor for IESParameterSpec that allows the use of cipher without a nonce has been deleted. See also details for CVE-2016-1000344, CVE-2016-1000352.</li>
<li>Strict encoding enforcement has been introduced for ASN1Integer.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000338: DSA does not fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of "invisible" data into a signed structure.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000339: AESFastEngine has a side channel leak if table accesses can be observed. The use of lookup large static lookup tables in AESFastEngine means that where data accesses by the CPU can be observed, it is possible to gain information about the key used to initialize the cipher. We now recommend not using AESFastEngine where this might be a concern. The BC provider is now using AESEngine by default.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000340: Static ECDH vulnerable to carry propagation bug.
Carry propagation bugs in the implementation of squaring for several raw math classes have been fixed (org.bouncycastle.math.raw.Nat???). These classes are used by our custom elliptic curve implementations (org.bouncycastle.math.ec.custom.**), so there was the possibility of rare (in general usage) spurious calculations for elliptic curve scalar multiplications. Such errors would have been detected with high probability by the output validation for our scalar multipliers.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000341: DSA signature generation vulnerable to timing attack. Where timings can be closely observed for the generation of signatures, the lack of blinding in 1.55 or earlier, may allow an attacker to gain information about the signatures k value and ultimately the private value as well.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000342: ECDSA does not fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of "invisible" data into a signed structure.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000343: DSA key pair generator generates a weak private key if used with default values. If the JCA key pair generator is not explicitly initialised with DSA parameters, 1.55 and earlier generates a private value assuming a 1024 bit key size. In earlier releases this can be dealt with by explicitly passing parameters to the key pair generator.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000344: DHIES allows the use of unsafe ECB mode. This algorithm is now removed from the provider.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000345: DHIES/ECIES CBC mode vulnerable to padding oracle attack. For BC 1.55 and older, in an environment where timings can be easily observed, it is possible with enough observations to identify when the decryption is failing due to padding.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000346: Other party DH public key not fully validated. This can cause issues as invalid keys can be used to reveal details about the other party's private key where static Diffie-Hellman is in use. As of this release the key parameters are checked on agreement calculation.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000352: ECIES allows the use of unsafe ECB mode. This algorithm is now removed from the provider.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>2.4.5 Security Advisory</h3>
<ul>
<li>We consider the carry propagation bugs fixed in this release to have been exploitable in previous releases (1.51-1.55), for static ECDH, to reveal the long-term key, per <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/633">"Practical realisation and elimination of an ECC-related software bug attack", Brumley et.al.</a>. The most common case of this would be the non-ephemeral ECDH ciphersuites in TLS. These are not enabled by default in our TLS implementations, but they can be enabled explicitly by users. We recommend that users DO NOT enable static ECDH ciphersuites for TLS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.5.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.55 <br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2016, August 18
<h3>2.5.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Issues with cloning of blake digests with salts and personalisation strings have been fixed.</li>
<li>The JceAsymmetricValueDecryptor in the CRMF package now attempts to recognise a wider range of parameters for the key wrapping algorithm, rather than relying on a default.</li>
<li>GCM now fails if an attempt is made to go past 2^32-1 blocks.</li>
<li>(r, k) ordering for Poly1305 has been modified to be brought into line with RFC 7539.</li>
<li>An occasional error in Poly1305 due to sign-extension has been fixed.</li>
<li>TimeStampRequest was always failing to validate if extensions were present. This has been fixed.</li>

<li>Creation of multiple providers concurrently could cause issues with a non-synchronized Map in the provider. Code is now synchronized.</li>
<li>If the lightweight OAEP encoder is fed oversized input it will now throw something more informative than an ArrayOutOfBoundsException or simply truncate.</li>
<li>Attempting to use the PasswordRecipientInfoGenerator without explicitly setting the salt would cause a NullPointerException. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The BasicConstraintsValidation in the CertPath API would throw a NullPointerException on an unconstrained path length. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>A shift error for > 24 bit numbers in TlsUtils has been fixed.</li>
<li>OAEP encryption for a zero length message would create invalid cipher text. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Trying to use of non-default parameters for OAEP in CRMF would resort to the default parameter set. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>If the BC provider was not registered, creating a CertificateFactory would cause a new provider object to be created. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.5.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>The DANE API has been updated to reflect the latest standard changes.</li>
<li>The signature algorithm SPHINCS-256 has been added to the post-quantum provider (BCPQC). Support is in place for SHA-512 and SHA3-512 (using trees based around SHA512_256 and SHA3_256 respectively).</li>
<li>The key exchange algorithm NewHope has been added to the post-quantum provider (BCPQC). Support is in place for the regular configuration using SHA3-256 as the flattening algorithm for the agreed value.</li>

<li>Support has been added for SHA-3 in DSA, ECDSA, DDSA, and ECDDSA. Aliases have been added for NIST OIDs for DSA and ECDSA as well.</li>
<li>Support has been added for SHA-3 with RSA PKCS 1.5, PSS, and OAEP.</li>

</ul>

<h3>2.6.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.54 <br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2015, December 29
<h3>2.6.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blake2b-160, Blake2b-256, Blake2b-384, and Blake2b-512 are now actually in the provider and an issue with cloning Blake2b digests has been fixed.</li>
<li>PKCS#5 Scheme 2 using DESede CBC is now supported by the PKCS#12 implementation.</li>
<li>The IES engine would sometimes throw a "too short" exception on small messages which were the right length. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Cipher.getOutputSize() for IES ciphers would throw a ClassCastException. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>It turns out, after advice one way and another that the NESSIE test vectors for Serpent are now what should be followed and that the vectors in the AES submission are regarded as an algorithm called Tnepres. The Serpent version now follows the NESSIE vectors, and the Tnepres cipher has been added to the provider and the lightweight API for compatibility.</li>
<li>Problems with DTLS record-layer version handling were resolved, making version negotiation work properly.
</ul>
<h3>2.6.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Camellia and SEED key wrapping are now supported for CMS key agreement</li>
<li>The BC TLS/DTLS code now includes a non-blocking API.</li>
<li>CTR/SIC mode now support an internal counter. The internal counter can be turned on by passing an IV smaller than the block size of the cipher's algorithm.</li>
<li>The lightweight CMS API operators now support CAST5 and RC2 CBC encryption.</li>
<li>The CMS API now supports Diffie-Hellman as specified in RFC 3370.</li>
<li>Support has been added to the CMS API for PKCS#7 ANY type encapsulated content where the encapsulated content is not an OCTET STRING.</li>
<li>PSSSigner in the lightweight API now supports fixed salts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.6.4 Security Advisory</h3>
<ul>
<li>(D)TLS 1.2: Motivated by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CVE-2015-7575">CVE-2015-7575</a>, we have added validation that the signature algorithm received in DigitallySigned structures is actually one of those offered (in signature_algorithms extension or CertificateRequest). With our default TLS configuration, we do not believe there is an exploitable vulnerability in any earlier releases. Users that are customizing the signature_algorithms extension, or running a server supporting client authentication, are advised to double-check that they are not offering any signature algorithms involving MD5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.6.5 Notes</h3>
<p>
If you have been using Serpent, you will need to either change to Tnepres, or take into account the fact that Serpent is now byte-swapped compared to what it was before.
</p>

<h3>2.7.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.53 <br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2015, October 10

<ul>
<li>The BC JCE cipher implementations could sometimes fail when used in conjunction with the JSSE and NIO. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>PGPPublicKey.getBitStrength() always returned 0 for EC keys. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>A PKCS12 key store containing a looping certificate chain could cause an OutOfMemoryException. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>A change in JDK 1.8 meant that X509Certificate.verify(PublicKey, Provider) would cause a stack overflow. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Nested multiparts with irregular post-amble could cause verification issues for the SMIMESigned classes. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>CMSSignedData now supports verification of signed attributes where the calculated digest uses a different algorithm from the digest used in the signature.</li>
<li>TRUSTED CERTIFICATE parsing in PEM files was ignoring the attribute block. A new class X509TrustedCertificateBlock is now returned containing both the certificate and the trust information.</li>
<li>Adding a password to a PGP key which did not previously have one would result in an improperly formatted key. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>ECIES/IES was only using a 4 byte label length for the MAC tag when it should have been an 8 byte one. This has now been fixed and OldECIES/OldIES has been added for backwards compatibility.</li>
<li>The JceCRMFEncryptorBuilder was not recognising key size specific object identifiers properly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The OpenPGP ClearSignedFileProcessor would not handle verification of single line files properly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The BC X509Certificate class was no longer in agreement with the standard class for hashCode(). The BC X509Certificate class will now track the changes made in the standard Java distribution.</li>
<li>PGP signature hashed sub-packets with long length encodings would fail to validate on signature checking. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The S/MIME API would occasionally leak InputStreams which could cause issues with custom DataSource implementations. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The PKCS#12 KeyStore implementation would sometimes leave orphaned chain certificates in the key store after private key deletion. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>A bug in the DirectKeySignature OpenPGP example which could lead to extra data appearing in the signature has been fixed.</li>
<li>Explicit configuration of a BcAsymmetricKeyWrapper with a SecureRandom was not properly propagated internally. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>A CRL with a null certificate issuer would sometimes result in a NullPointerException during CertPathProcessing. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The CertPath processor would occasionally fail to match a DistributionPoint name correctly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>In order to avoid confusion about thread safety, BCrypt now uses a new instance for hash calculation every time it is invoked.</li>
<li>Some decidedly odd argument casting in the PKIXCertPathValidator has been fixed to throw an InvalidAlgorithmParameterException.</li>
<li>Presenting an empty array of certificates to the PKIXCertPathValidator would cause an IndexOutOfRangeException instead of a CertPathValidatorException. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.7.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to specify that an unwrapped key must be usable by a software provider in the asymmetric unwrappers for CMS.</li>
<li>A Blake2b implementation has been added to the provider and lightweight API.</li>
<li>SHA3 has now been added to the provider and the lightweight API. SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 have also been added to the lightweight API. The original implementation of the draft standard has been renamed to Keccak.</li>
<li>The CMS API now supports RFC 6211 for both SignedData and AuthenticatedData.</li>
<li>The ASN.1 parser for ECGOST private keys will now parse keys encoded with a private value represented as an ASN.1 INTEGER.</li>
<li>EAX mode and CMAC is now supported for ciphers such as SHACAL-2 and Threefish.</li>
<li>The SM4 block cipher has been added to the provider and the lightweight API.</li>

<li>A range of new algorithms are now support for EC key agreement.</li>
<li>EC ContentSigners and EC ContentVerifiers have been added to the lightweight operator package in the PKIX APIs.</li>
<li>The PKCS#12 key store will now garbage collect orphaned certificates on saving.</li>
<li>Caching for ASN.1 ObjectIdentifiers has been rewritten to make use of an intern method. The "usual suspects" are now interned automatically, and the cache is used by the parser. Other OIDs can be added to the cache by calling ASN1ObjectIdentifier.intern().</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.7.4 Notes</h3>
<p>
It turns out there was a similar, but different, issue in Crypto++ to the BC issue with ECIES. Crypto++ 6.0 now offers a corrected version of ECIES which is compatible with that which is now in BC.
</p>

<h3>2.8.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.52<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2015, March 2
<h3>2.8.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>GenericSigner in the lightweight API would fail if the digest started with a zero byte, occasionally causing a TLS negotiation to fail. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Some BC internal classes expected the BC provider to be accessible within the provider. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Email based policy constraints in CertPath validation did not include '@'domain.name as a possible match. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The Shacal2Engine would throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if presented with input longer than a block size. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Using PKCS5/PKCS7 with pad values greater than 127 would result in an exception on decryption. This has been fixed.</li>

<h3>2.13.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>OpenPGP ID based certifications now support UTF-8.

</ul>

<h3>2.13.4 Other notes</h3>
<p>
Okay, so we have had to do another release. The issue we have run into is that we probably didn't go far enough in 1.46, but we are now confident that moving from this release to 2.0 should be largely just getting rid of deprecated methods. While this release does change a lot it is relatively straight forward to do a port and we have a <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/display/JA1/Porting+from+earlier+BC+releases+to+1.47+and+later">porting guide</a> which explains the important ones. The area there has been the most change in is the ASN.1 library which was in bad need of a rewrite after 10 years of patching. On the bright side the rewrite did allow us to eliminate a few problems and bugs in the ASN.1 library, so we have some hope anyone porting to it will also have similar benefits. As with 1.46 the other point of emphasis has been making sure interface support is available for operations across the major APIs, so the lightweight API or some local role your own methods can be used instead for doing encryption and signing.
</p>

<h3>2.14.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.46</br>

</ul>
<h3>2.14.4 Other notes</h3>
<p>
Baring security patches we expect 1.46 will be the last of the 1.* releases. The next release of
BC will be version 2.0. For this reason a lot of things in 1.46 that relate to CMS have been deprecated and
new methods have been added to the CMS and certificate handling APIs which provide greater flexibility
in how digest and signature algorithms get used. It is now possible to use the lightweight API or a simple
custom API with CMS and for certificate generation. In addition a lot of methods and some classes that were
deprecated for reasons of been confusing, or in some cases just plan wrong, have been removed. 
</p>
<p>
So there are four things useful to know about this release:
<ul>
<li>It's not a simple drop in like previous releases, if you wish migrate to it you will need to recompile your application.</li>
<li>If you avoid deprecated methods it should be relatively painless to move to version 2.0</li>
<li>The X509Name class will utlimately be replacde with the X500Name class, the getInstance() methods on both these classes allow conversion from one type to another.</li>
<li>The org.bouncycastle.cms.RecipientId class now has a collection of subclasses to allow for more specific recipient matching. If you are creating your own recipient ids you should use the constructors for the subclasses rather than relying on the set methods inherited from X509CertSelector. The dependencies on X509CertSelector and CertStore will be removed from the version 2 CMS API.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>2.46.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.14<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2002, June 17
<h3>2.46.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>there was a bug in the BigInteger right shifting for > 31 bit shifts.
This has been fixed.
<li>x509 name had it's equality test based on the order of the directory
elements, this has been fixed.
<li>the mode used with the RSA cipher in KeyTransRecipientInfoParser in
the smime implementation was not compatible with the Sun JCE.
This has been fixed.
<li>PKCS7 SignedData now supports single length signing chains.
<li>When a root certificate had a different issuer id from the subject id, or
had it's own AuthorityKeyExtension the PKCS12 key store would drop the root
certificate from the certificate chain. This has been fixed.
<li>The PKCS10 CertificationRequestInfo class always expected at least one
attribute. This has been fixed.
<li>UTF8 strings are now correctly recognised.
<li>The Tiger implementation was producing results in reverse byte
order for each of the 3 words making up the digest. This has been fixed.
<li>asn1.x509.ExtendedKeyUsage used to through a null pointer exception
on construction. This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.46.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>The BigInteger library now uses Montgomery numbers for modPow and is
substantially faster.
<li>SMIMECapabilities, and SMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference attributes added to S/MIME.
<li>Increased range of key sizes available in S/MIME.

</ul>
<h3>2.47.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.13<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2002, April 19
<h3>2.47.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The TBSCertificate object in the ASN.1 library now properly implements
    the Time object, rather returning UTC time.
    <li>The DESedeKeyGenerator now supports 112 and 168 bit key generation.
    <li>Certificates with the keyId set to null in the AuthorityKeyIdentifier extensions would sometimes cause the PKCS12 store to throw a NullPointer exception. This has been fixed.
    <li>toByteArray in the big integer class was not always producing correct
    results for negative numbers. This has been Fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.47.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The key to keySpec handling of the secret key factories has been improved.
    <li>There is now a SMIME implementation and a more complete CMS
        implementation (see CONTRIBUTORS file for additonal details).
    <li>A CertPath implementation that runs under jdk1.1 and jdk1.4 has also
    being contributed. A work around to allow it to be used with jdk1.2 and
    jdk1.3 has also been added. Note: the implementation is not quite complete
    because policymapping, name and subtree constraints are not yet
    implemented.
    <li>The API now supports the generation of PKCS7 signed objects. Note: this
    is still beta code - one known issue is that it doesn't support single
    length certificate chains for signing keys.
</ul>

<h3>2.48.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.12<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2002, February 8
<h3>2.48.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The ASN.1 library was unable to read an empty set object. This has been fixed.
    <li>Returning sets of critical and non-critical extensions on X.509 certificates could result in a null pointer exception if the certificate had no extensions. This has been fixed.
    <li>The BC JKS implementation does not follow the conventional one - it has been renamed BKS, an attempt to create a JKS keystore using the BC provider will now result in an exception.
    <li>The PKCS 10 generator verify(provider) method was ignoring the provider when generating the public key. This has been fixed.
    <li>The PKCS12 store would throw an OutOfMemoryException if passed a non-PKCS12 file. This has been fixed.
    <li>In the case where there was no AuthorityKeyIdentifier the PKCS12 store
    would fail to find certificates further up the signing chain. The store now
    uses the IssuerDN if no AuthorityKeyIdentifier is specified and the IssuerDN
    is different from the SubjectDN,
    <li>PKCS10/CertificationRequestInfo objects with only a single attribute wer
    not being handled properly. This has been fixed.
    <li>getExtensionValue for X.509 CRLs was returning the value of the
    DER-Encoded octet string not the DER-Encoded octet string as required. This
    has been fixed.
    <li>the IV algorithm parameters class would improperly throw an exception
    on initialisation. This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.48.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The AESWrap ciphers will now take IV's.
    <li>The DES-EDEWrap algorithm described in http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-smime-key-wrap-01.txt is now supported.
    <li>Support for the ExtendedKeyUsageExtension and the KeyPurposeId has been added.
    <li>The OID based alias for DSA has been added to the JCE provider.
    <li>BC key stores now implement the BCKeyStore interface so you can provide your own source of randomness to a key store.
    <li>The ASN.1 library now supports GeneralizedTime.
    <li>HMACSHA256, HMACSHA384, and HMACSHA512 are now added.
    <li>PSS has been added to the JCE, PSS and ISO9796 signers in the lightweight api have been rewritten so they can be used incrementally. SHA256withRSA, SHA384withRSA, and SHA512withRSA have been added.
    <li>Base support for CMS (RFC 2630) is now provided (see CONTRIBUTORS file
    for details).
</ul>
<h3>2.49.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.11<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, December 10
<h3>2.49.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>X9.23 padding of MACs now works correctly with block size aligned data.
<li>Loading a corrupted "UBER" key store would occasionally cause the
appearance of hanging. This has been fixed.
<li>Loading a PKCS12 store where not all certificates had PKCS9 attributes
assigned to them would cause a NullPointerException. This has been fixed.
<li>The PKCS12 store wasn't correctly recovering certificate chains of
length less than 2 on calling the getCertificateChain method. This has been
fixed.
<li>Lone certificates were not been stored in the PKCS12 store. This has been fixed.
<li>CFB and OFB modes weren't padding iv's more than 1 byte less than the 
block size of the cipher if the mode was reused with a shorter IV. This has
been fixed.
<li>IV handling and block size return values for CFB and OFB modes wasn't being handled in the same way as the Sun reference implementation. This has been fixed.
<li>CertificateInfoRequests were not handling null attributes correctly. This
has been fixed.
<li>Tags for the X.509 GeneralName structure were wrongly encoded. This has been
fixed.
<li>getExtensionValue for X.509 certificates was returning the value of the
DER-Encoded octet string not the DER-Encoded octet string as required. This has
been fixed.
<li>reset on the version 3 X.509 certificate generator was not flushing the
extensions. This has been fixed.
<li>The NetscapeCert type bits were reversed! This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.49.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>The lightweight API and the JCE provider now support ElGamal.
<li>X509Principal, and X509Name now supports the "DC" attribute and the
creation of directory names from vectors.
<li>RSA-PSS signature padding has been added to the lightweight API.
<li>EC Public/Private keys are now encoded in accordance with SEC 1. The library
will still read older keys as well.
<li>Added PKCS12-DEF a pkcs12 based key store which works around a bug in
the Sun keytool - it always uses the default provider for creating certificates.
<li>A cut down version of the Rijndael has been added that provides the functionality required to conform the the AES. It is designed to fully support FIPS-197. A fips AES wrapper (AESWrap in the JCE, AESWrapEngine in the lightweight library has also been added).
<li>Elliptic curve routines now handle uncompressed points as well as the
compressed ones.
</ul>
<h3>2.49.4 Other changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>As the range of public key types supported has expanded the getPublicKey
method on the SubjectPublicKeyInfo class is not always going to work. The
more generic method getPublicKeyData has been added and getPublicKey now
throws an IOException if there is a problem.
</ul>
<h3>2.50.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.10<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, October 20
<h3>2.50.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The PKCS12 Key Store now interoperates with the JDK key tool. <b>Note:</b> this does mean the the key name passed to the setKeyEntry calls has become
significant.
<li>The "int" constructor for DERInteger only supported ints up to 128. This
has been fixed.
<li>The ASN.1 input streams now handle zero-tagged zero length objects correctly.
</ul>
<h3>2.50.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>The JCE Provider and the lightweight API now support Serpent, CAST5, and CAST6.
<li>The JCE provider and the lightweight API now has an implementation of ECIES.
<b>Note:</b> this is based on a draft, don't use it for anything that needs to
be kept long term as it may be adjusted.
<li>Further work has been done on performance - mainly in the symmetric ciphers.
<li>Support for the generation of PKCS10 certification requests has been added.
</ul>
<h3>2.51.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.09<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, October 6
<h3>2.51.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>failure to pass in an RC5 parameters object now results in an exception
at the upper level of the JCE, rather than falling over in the lightweight
library.
<li>ISO10126Padding now incorporates the correct amount of random data.
<li>The PKCS12 key store wasn't picking up certificate chains properly
when being used to write PKCS12 files. This has been fixed.
<li>The Twofish engine would call System.exit if the key was too large.
This has been fixed.
<li>In some cases the ASN.1 library wouldn't handle implicit tagging properly.
This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.51.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for RC5-64 has been added to the JCE.
<li>ISO9796-2 signatures have been added to the JCE and lightweight API.
<li>A more general paddings packge for use with MACs and block ciphers had been aded to the lightweight API. MACs now allow you to specify padding.
<li>X9.23 Padding has been added to the JCE and lightwieght API. The old
PaddedBlockCipher class is now deprecated see org.bouncycastle.crypto.paddings for details.
<li>SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 are now added. Note: while the public review
period has finished, these algorithms have not yet been standardised, in the
event that final standardisation changes the algorithms these implementations
will be changed.
<li>It's now possible to set bag attributes on items to go into a PKCS12 store,
using the org.bouncycastle.jce.interfaces.PKCS12BagAttributeCarrier interface.
<li>More classses have been added to the ASN.1 package for dealing with
certificate extensions and CRLs including a CRL generator. Note: the
CRL generators should be regarded as under development and subject to change.
<li>There's now an examples package for the JCE (in addition to the examples
in org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.test) - org.bouncycastle.jce.examples. It
currently consists of a class showing how to generate a PKCS12 file.
<li>The X.509 CertificateFactory now includes CRL support.  DER or PEM CRLs may be processed.
<li>The BigInteger library has been written with a view to making it less
resource hungry and faster - whether it's fast enough remains to be seen!
</ul>

<h3>2.52.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.08<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, September 9
<h3>2.52.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>It wasn't possible to specify an ordering for distinguished names in
X509 certificates. This is now supported.
<li>In some circumstances stream Ciphers in the JCE would cause null pointer
exceptions on doFinal. This has been fixed.
<li>Unpadded ciphers would sometimes buffer the last block of input, even
if it could be processed. This has been fixed.
<li>The netscape certificate request class wouldn't compile under JDK 1.1. This
has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.52.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>ISO 9796-1 padding is now supported with RSA in the lightweight
API and the JCE.
<li>support classes have been added for reading and writing PKCS 12 files,
including a keystore for the JCA.
<li>The message digests MD4, Tiger, and RIPEMD128 have been added to the
JCE and the lightweight API. Note: MD4 and RIPEMD128 have been added for
compatibility purposes only - we recommend you don't use them for anything new!
<li>The JDK 1.1 certificate classes didn't conform to the JDK 1.2 API as
the collections class was not present. Thanks to a donated collections API
this is fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.53.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.07<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, July 9
<h3>2.53.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>It turned out that the setOddParity method in the DESParameter class
was indeed doing something odd but not what was intended. This is now
fixed. <b>Note:</b>This will affect some PBE encryptions that were carried
out with DES, equivalent PBE ciphers to the old PBE DES cipher can be
accessed by prepending the work "Broken" in front of the original PBE cipher
call. If you want an example of how to deal with this as a migration issue
have a look in org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JDKKeyStore lines 201-291.
</ul>
<h3>2.54.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.06<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, July 2
<h3>2.54.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Diffie-Hellman keys are now properly serialisable as well as
encodable.
<li>Three of the semi-weak keys in the DESParameters, and the DESKeySpec look
up table, were incorrect. This has been fixed.
<li>DESEDE key generators now accept 112 and 168 as the key sizes, as well
as 128 and 192 (for those people who don't like to count the parity bits).
<li>Providing no strength parameter is passed to the DESede key generator in
the JCE provider, the provider now generates DESede keys in the k1-k2-k1
format (which is compatible with the Sun reference implementation), otherwise
you get what you ask for (3-DES or 2-DES in the minimum number of bytes).
<li>Base Diffie-Hellman key agreement now works correctly for more than two
parties.
<li>Cipher.getAlgorithmParameters was returing null in cases where a cipher
object had generated it's own IV. This has been fixed.
<li>An error in the key store occasionally caused checks of entry types to
result in a null pointer exception. This has been fixed.
<li>RSA key generator in JCE now recognises RSAKeyGenerationParameterSpec.
<li>Resetting and resusing HMacs in the lightweight and heavyweight libraries
caused a NullPointer exception. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.54.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>ISO10126Padding is now recognised explicitly for block ciphers
as well.
<li>The Blowfish implementation is now somewhat faster.
</ul>

<h3>2.55.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.05<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, April 17
<h3>2.55.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The DESEDE key generator can now be used to generate 2-Key-DESEDE
keys as well as 3-Key-DESEDE keys.
<li>One of the weak keys in the DESParameters, and the DESKeySpec look
up table, was incorrect. This has been fixed.
<li>The PKCS12 generator was only generating the first 128-160 bits of the
key correctly (depending on the digest used). This has been fixed.
<li>The ASN.1 library was skipping explicitly tagged objects of zero length.
This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.55.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is now an org.bouncycastle.jce.netscape package which has
a class in for dealing with Netscape Certificate Request objects.
</ul>
<h3>2.55.4 Additional Notes</h3>
<p>
Concerning the PKCS12 fix: in a few cases this may cause some backward
compatibility issues - if this happens to you, drop us a line at
<a href="mailto:feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org">feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org</a>
and we will help you get it sorted out.

<h3>2.56.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.04<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, March 11
<h3>2.56.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Signatures generated by other providers that include optional null
parameters in the AlgorithmIdentifier are now handled correctly by the
provider.
<li>The JCE 1.2.1 states that the names of algorithms associated with the JCE
are case insensitive. The class that matches algorithms to names now tries
to match the name given with it's equivalent in upper case, before trying
to match it as given. If you write a provider and include versions of your
algorithm names in uppercase only, this JCE implementation will always
match a getInstance regardless of the case of the algorithm passed into
the getInstance method.
<li>If the JCE API and the Provider were in a different class path, the
class loader being used sometimes failed to find classes for JCE Ciphers, etc.
This has been fixed.
<li>An error in the ASN.1 library was causing problems serialising Diffie-Hellman keys. This has been fixed.
<li>The agreement package was left out of the j2me bat file. This has been fixed.
<li>The BigInteger class for 1.0 and the j2me wasn't able to generate random
integers (prime or otherwise). This has been fixed. 
<li>The BigInteger class would sometimes go into a death spiral if the any
32nd bit of an exponent was set when modPow was called. This has been fixed. 
<li>Cipher.getInstance would treat "//" in a transformation as a single "/".
This has been fixed.
<li>PBEWithSHAAndIDEA-CBC was throwing an exception on initialisation. This has
been fixed.
<li>The X509Name class in the asn1.x509 package wasn't initialising its local
hash table when the hash table constructor was called. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.56.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added Elliptic Curve DSA (X9.62) - ECDSA - to provider and lightweight
library.
<li>Added Elliptic Curve basic Diffie-Hellman to provider and lightweight
library.
<li>Added DSA support to the provider and the lightweight library.
<li>Added super class interfaces for basic Diffie-Hellman agreement classes
to lightweight library.
<li>The certificate generators now support ECDSA and DSA certs as well.
</ul>

<h3>2.57.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.03<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, January 7
<h3>2.57.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>CFB and OFB modes when specified without padding would insist on input
being block aligned. When specified without padding CFB and OFB now behave in a compatible 
fashion (a doFinal on a partial block will yield just the data that could
be processed).
In short, it provides another way of generating cipher text the same
length as the plain text.
</ul>

<h3>2.58.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.02<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000, November 7
<h3>2.58.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RSA key pair generator occasionally produced keys 1 bit under the
requested size. This is now fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.59.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.01<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000, October 15
<h3>2.59.2 Defects Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Buffered ciphers in lightweight library were not resetting correctly
on a doFinal. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.60.1 Version</h3>
Release: 1.00<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000, October 13
<h3>2.60.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>JDK1.2 version now works with keytool for certificate generation.
<li>Certificate toString method no longer throws a null pointer exception
if a group [3] extension has not been added.
<li>Under some circumstances the NullCipher would throw a NullPointerException,
this has been fixed.
<li>Under some circumstances CipherInputStream would throw a NullPointerException, this has been fixed.
<li>OpenSSL/SSLeay private key encodings would cause an exception to be thrown
by the RSA key factory. This is now fixed.
<li>The Cipher class always used the default provider even when one was specified, this has been fixed.
<li>Some DES PBE algorithms did not set the parity correctly in generated keys, this has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.60.3 Additional functionality</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Argument validation is much improved.
<li>An X509KeyUsage class has been added to the JCE class to make it easier
to specify the KeyUsage extension on X.509 certificates.
<li>The library now allows creation of version 1 certificates as well.
</ul>

<h3>3.0 Notes</h3>
<p>
The J2ME is only supported under Windows.
<p>
If you are trying to use the lightweight provider in a JDK 1.0 applet, you
need to change the package names for java.math.BigInteger, java.lang.IllegalStateException, and java.security.SecureRandom
<p>
The RSA test under JDK 1.0 and J2ME takes a while to run...
