<h1>Bouncy Castle Crypto Package - Release Notes</h1>
</center>
<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of 
cryptographic algorithms.  The package is organised so that it 
contains a light-weight API suitable for use in any environment
(including the J2ME) with the additional infrastructure
to conform the algorithms to the JCE framework.
</p>
<h2>2.0 Release History</h2>

<h3>2.3.4 Notes.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both versions of NTRUPrime have been updated to produce 256 bit secrets in line with Kyber. This should also bring them into line with other implementations such as those used in OpenSSH now.</li>
<li>BCJSSE: The boolean system property 'org.bouncycastle.jsse.fips.allowRSAKeyExchange" now defaults to false. All RSA
key exchange cipher suites will therefore be disabled when the BCJSSE provider is used in FIPS mode, unless this system
property is explicitly set to true.</li>
<li>OSGi compatibility should now be much improved.</li>
<li>SignedMailValidator now includes a more general rollback method for locating the signature's trust anchor for use when the first approach fails.</li>
<li>The PKCS12 store using GCM does not include the PKCS#12 MAC so no longer includes use of the PKCS#12 PBE scheme and only uses PBKDF2.</li>
<li>In keeping with the current set of experimental OIDs for PQC algorithms, OIDs may have changed to reflect updated versions of the algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.3.5 Security Advisories.</h3>
<p>
Release 1.78 deals with the following CVEs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2024-29857 - Importing an EC certificate with specially crafted F2m parameters can cause high CPU usage during parameter evaluation.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-30171 - Possible timing based leakage in RSA based handshakes due to exception processing eliminated.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-30172 - Crafted signature and public key can be used to trigger an infinite loop in the Ed25519 verification code.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-34447 - When endpoint identification is enabled in the BCJSSE and an SSL socket is not created with an explicit hostname (as happens with HttpsURLConnection), hostname verification could be performed against a DNS-resolved IP address. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>BCJSSE: For OCSP server stapling to be enabled, the property jdk.tls.server.enableStatusRequestExtension must be
set to true. Other properties that control stapling are also available: jdk.tls.server.[cacheSize | cacheLifetime
| responseTimeout | responderURI | responderOverride | ignoreExtensions]</li>
</ul>

<a id="r1rv77"><h3>2.4.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.77<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2023, November 13th
<h3>2.4.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using an unescaped '=' in an X.500 RDN would result in the RDN being truncated silently. The issue is now detected and an exception is thrown.</li>
<li>asn1.eac.CertificateBody was returning certificateEffectiveDate from getCertificateExpirationDate(). This has been fixed to return certificateExpirationDate.</li> 
<li>DTLS: Fixed retransmission in response to re-receipt of an aggregated ChangeCipherSpec.</li>
<li>(D)TLS: Fixed compliance for supported_groups extension. Server will no longer negotiate an EC cipher suite using a default curve when the ClientHello includes
the supported_groups extension but it contains no curves in common with the server. Similarly, a DH cipher suite will not be negotiated when the ClientHello includes
supported_groups, containing at least one FFDHE group, but none in common with the server.</li>
<li>IllegalStateException was being thrown by the Ed25519/Ed448 SignatureSpi. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>TLS: class annotation issues that could occur between the BC provider and the TLS API for the GCMParameterSpec class when the jars were loaded on the boot class path have been addressed.</li>
<li>Attempt to create an ASN.1 OID from a zero length byte array is now caught at construction time.</li>
<li>Attempt to create an X.509 extension block which is empty will now be blocked cause an exception.</li>
<li>IES implementation will now accept a null ParameterSpec if no nonce is needed.</li>
<li>An internal method in Arrays was failing to construct its failure message correctly on an error. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>HSSKeyPublicParameters.generateLMSContext() would fail for a unit depth key. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.4.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>BCJSSE: Added org.bouncycastle.jsse.client.omitSigAlgsCertExtension and org.bouncycastle.jsse.server.omitSigAlgsCertExtension boolean system properties
to control (for client and server resp.) whether the signature_algorithms_cert extension should be omitted if it would be identical to signature_algorithms.
Defaults to true, the historical behaviour.</li>
<li>The low-level HPKE API now allows the sender to specify an ephemeral key pair.</li>
<li>Support has been added for the delta-certificate requests in line with the current Chameleon Cert draft from the IETF.</li>
<li>Some accommodation has been added for historical systems to accommodate variations in the SHA-1 digest OID for CMS SignedData.</li>
<li>TLS: the TLS API will now try "RSAwithDigestAndMFG1" as well as the newer RSAPSS algorithm names when used with the JCA.</li>
<li>TLS: RSA key exchange cipher suites are now disabled by default.</li>
<li>Support has been added for PKCS#10 requests to allow certificates using the altSignature/altPublicKey extensions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.4.4 Notes.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kyber and Dilithium have been updated according to the latest draft of the standard. Dilithium-AES and Kyber-AES have now been removed. Kyber now produces 256 bit secrets for all parameter sets (in line with the draft standard).</li>
<li>NTRU has been updated to produce 256 bit secrets in line with Kyber.</li>
<li>SPHINCS+ can now be used to generate certificates in line with those used by (Open Quantum Safe) OQS.</li>
<li>Falcon object identifiers are now in line with OQS as well.</li>
<li>PQC CMS SignedData now defaults to SHA-256 for signed attributes rather than SHAKE-256. This is also a compatibility change, but may change further again as the IETF standard for CMS is updated.</li>
</ul>

<a id="r1rv76"><h3>2.5.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.76<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2023, July 29th
<h3>2.5.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>

<li>JceKeyFingerPrintCalculator has been generalised for different providers by using "SHA-256" for the algorithm string.</li>
<li>BCJSSE: Fixed a regression in 1.74 (NullPointerException) that prevents a BCJSSE server from negotiating TLSv1.1 or earlier.</li>
<li>DTLS: Fixed server support for client_certificate_type extension.</li>
<li>Cipher.unwrap() for HQC could fail due to a miscalculation of the length of the KEM packet. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>There was exposure to a Java 7 method in the Java 5 to Java 8 BCTLS jar which could cause issues with some TLS 1.2 cipher suites running on older JVMs. This is now fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.5.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>BCJSSE: Following OpenJDK, finalizers have been removed from SSLSocket subclasses. Applications should close sockets and not rely on garbage collection.</li>

<li>Context based sanity checking on PGP signatures has been added.</li>
<li>The ParallelHash clone constructor was not copying all fields. This is now fixed.</li>
<li>The maximimum number of blocks for CTR/SIC modes was 1 block less than it should have been. This is now fixed.</li>

<ul>
<li>The PGP API now supports wildcard key IDs for public key based data encryption.</li>
<li>LMS now supports SHA256/192, SHAKE256/192, and SHAKE256/256 (the additional SP 8000-208 parameter sets).</li>
<li>The PGP API now supports V5 and V6 AEAD encryption for encrypted data packets.</li>
<li>The PGP examples have been updated to reflect key size and algorithm changes that have occurred since they were first written (10+ years...).</li>
<li>(D)TLS: A new callback 'TlsPeer.notifyConnectionClosed' will be called when the connection is closed (including by failure).</li>
<li>BCJSSE: Improved logging of connection events and include unique IDs in connection-specific log messages.</li>
<li>BCJSSE: Server now logs the offered cipher suites when it fails to select one.</li>
<li>BCJSSE: Added support for SSLParameters namedGroups and signatureSchemes properties (can also be used via BCJSSE extension API in earlier Java versions).</li>
<li>DTLS: The initial handshake re-send time is now configurable by overriding 'TlsPeer.getHandshakeResendTimeMillis'.</li>
<li>DTLS: Added support for connection IDs per RFC 9146.</li>
<li>DTLS: Performance of DTLSVerifier has been improved so that it can reasonably be used for all incoming packets.</li>

<li>The property "org.bouncycastle.emulate.oracle" has been added to signal the provider should return algorithm names on some algorithms in the same manner as the Oracle JCE provider.</li>
<li>An extra replaceSigners method has been added to CMSSignedData which allows for specifying the digest algorithm IDs to be used in the new CMSSignedData object.</li>
<li>Parsing and re-encoding of ASN.1 PEM data has been further optimized to prevent unecessary conversions between basic encoding, definite length, and DER.</li>
<li>Support has been added for KEM ciphers in CMS in accordance with <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-lamps-cms-kemri-00.html">draft-ietf-lamps-cms-kemri</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>2.8.4 Security Advisories.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The PQC implementations have now been subject to formal review for secret leakage and side channels, there were issues in BIKE, Falcon, Frodo, HQC which have now been fixed. Some weak positives also showed up in Rainbow, Picnic, SIKE, and GeMSS - for now this last set has been ignored as the algorithms will either be updated if they reappear in the Signature Round, or deleted, as is already the case for SIKE (it is now in the legacy package). Details on the group responsible for the testing can be found in the <a href="../CONTRIBUTORS.html">CONTRIBUTORS</a> file.</li>
<li>For at least some ECIES variants (e.g. when using CBC) there is an issue with potential malleability of a nonce (implying silent malleability of the plaintext) that must be sent alongside the ciphertext but is outside the IES integrity check. For this reason the automatic generation of nonces with IED is now disabled and they have to be passed in using an IESParameterSpec. The current advice is to agree on a nonce between parties and then rely on the use of the ephemeral key component to allow the nonce (rather the so called nonce) usage to be extended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.8.5 Notes.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most test data files have now been migrated to a separate project bc-test-data which is also available on github. If you clone bc-test-data at the same level as the bc-java project the tests will find the test data they require.</li>
<li>There has been further work to make entropy collection more friendly in container environments. See <a hef="https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/blob/master/prov/src/main/java/org/bouncycastle/jcajce/provider/drbg/DRBG.java">DRBG.java</a> for details. We would welcome any further feedback on this as we clearly cannot try all situations first hand.</li>

<h3>2.11.4 Notes</h3>
<p>
Keep in mind the PQC algorithms are still under development and we are still at least a year and a half away from published standards. This means the algorithms may still change so by all means experiment, but do not use the PQC algoritms for anything long term.
</p>
<p>
The legacy "Rainbow" and "McEliece" implementations have been removed from the BCPQC provider. The underlying classes are still present if required. Other legacy algorithm implementations can be found under the org.bouncycastle.pqc.legacy package.
</p>
<h3>2.11.5 Security Notes</h3>
<p>
The PQC SIKE algorithm is provided for research purposes only. It should now be regarded as broken. The SIKE implementation will be withdrawn in BC 1.73.

<li>Passing a PKCS12 key to a Mac in the BC JCE always resulted in SHA-1 being used to process the password regardless of the underlying MAC algorithm. This has been fixed. An unrecognised HMAC will also now result in an exception.</li>
<li>The Base64 encoder now explicitly validates 2 character padding as being "==".</li>
<li>EC FixedPointCombMultiplier avoids 'infinity' point in lookup tables, reducing timing side-channels.</li>
<li>Reuse of a Blake2b digest with a call to reset() rather than doFinal() could result in incorrect padding being introduced and the wrong digest result produced. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.26.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>ARIA (RFC 5794) is now supported by the provider and the lightweight API.</li>
<li>ARIA Key Wrapping (RFC 5649 style) is now supported by the provider and the lightweight API.</li>
<li>SM2 signatures, key exchange, and public key encryption has been added to the lightweight API.</li>
<li>XMSS has been added to the lightweight PQ API. Note: this should be treated as beta code.</li>
<li>API support for client side EST (RFC 7030), as well as some CMC (RFC 5273) has been added to the PKIX API. A full set of ASN.1 classes for both protocols has been added as well.</li>

<li>The BCJSSE provider now supports SSLContext.getDefault(), with very similar behaviour to the SunJSSE provider, including checks of the relevant javax.net.ssl.* system properties and auto-loading of jssecacerts or cacerts as the default trust store.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.26.4 Security Related Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The default parameter sizes for DH and DSA are now 2048. If you have been relying on key pair generation without passing in parameters generated keys will now be larger.</li>
<li>Further work has been done on preventing accidental re-use of a GCM cipher without first changing its key or iv.</li>
</ul>

<li>SHA-3 support has been added to BcDefaultDigestProvider.</li>
<li>A higher level TLS API and JSSE provider have been added to the project.</li>
</ul>
<a id="CVE156"><h3>2.27.4 Security Related Changes and CVE's Addressed by this Release</h3></a>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to configure the provider to only import keys for specific named curves.</li>
<li>Work has been done to improve the "constant time" behaviour of the RSA padding mechanisms.</li>
<li>The GCM ciphers in the JCE and lightweight API will now fail if an attempt is made to use them for encryption after a doFinal or without changing the IV.</li>
<li>The constructor for IESParameterSpec that allows the use of cipher without a nonce has been deleted. See also details for CVE-2016-1000344, CVE-2016-1000352.</li>
<li>Strict encoding enforcement has been introduced for ASN1Integer.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000338: DSA does not fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of "invisible" data into a signed structure.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000339: AESFastEngine has a side channel leak if table accesses can be observed. The use of lookup large static lookup tables in AESFastEngine means that where data accesses by the CPU can be observed, it is possible to gain information about the key used to initialize the cipher. We now recommend not using AESFastEngine where this might be a concern. The BC provider is now using AESEngine by default.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000340: Static ECDH vulnerable to carry propagation bug.
Carry propagation bugs in the implementation of squaring for several raw math classes have been fixed (org.bouncycastle.math.raw.Nat???). These classes are used by our custom elliptic curve implementations (org.bouncycastle.math.ec.custom.**), so there was the possibility of rare (in general usage) spurious calculations for elliptic curve scalar multiplications. Such errors would have been detected with high probability by the output validation for our scalar multipliers.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000341: DSA signature generation vulnerable to timing attack. Where timings can be closely observed for the generation of signatures, the lack of blinding in 1.55 or earlier, may allow an attacker to gain information about the signatures k value and ultimately the private value as well.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000342: ECDSA does not fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of "invisible" data into a signed structure.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000343: DSA key pair generator generates a weak private key if used with default values. If the JCA key pair generator is not explicitly initialised with DSA parameters, 1.55 and earlier generates a private value assuming a 1024 bit key size. In earlier releases this can be dealt with by explicitly passing parameters to the key pair generator.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000344: DHIES allows the use of unsafe ECB mode. This algorithm is now removed from the provider.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000345: DHIES/ECIES CBC mode vulnerable to padding oracle attack. For BC 1.55 and older, in an environment where timings can be easily observed, it is possible with enough observations to identify when the decryption is failing due to padding.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000346: Other party DH public key not fully validated. This can cause issues as invalid keys can be used to reveal details about the other party's private key where static Diffie-Hellman is in use. As of this release the key parameters are checked on agreement calculation.</li>
<li>CVE-2016-1000352: ECIES allows the use of unsafe ECB mode. This algorithm is now removed from the provider.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.27.5 Security Advisory</h3>
<ul>
<li>We consider the carry propagation bugs fixed in this release to have been exploitable in previous releases (1.51-1.55), for static ECDH, to reveal the long-term key, per <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/633">"Practical realisation and elimination of an ECC-related software bug attack", Brumley et.al.</a>. The most common case of this would be the non-ephemeral ECDH ciphersuites in TLS. These are not enabled by default in our TLS implementations, but they can be enabled explicitly by users. We recommend that users DO NOT enable static ECDH ciphersuites for TLS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.28.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>

<li>A shift error for > 24 bit numbers in TlsUtils has been fixed.</li>
<li>OAEP encryption for a zero length message would create invalid cipher text. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Trying to use of non-default parameters for OAEP in CRMF would resort to the default parameter set. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>If the BC provider was not registered, creating a CertificateFactory would cause a new provider object to be created. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.28.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>The DANE API has been updated to reflect the latest standard changes.</li>
<li>The signature algorithm SPHINCS-256 has been added to the post-quantum provider (BCPQC). Support is in place for SHA-512 and SHA3-512 (using trees based around SHA512_256 and SHA3_256 respectively).</li>
<li>The key exchange algorithm NewHope has been added to the post-quantum provider (BCPQC). Support is in place for the regular configuration using SHA3-256 as the flattening algorithm for the agreed value.</li>

<a id="r1rv54"><h3>2.29.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.54 <br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2015, December 29
<h3>2.29.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blake2b-160, Blake2b-256, Blake2b-384, and Blake2b-512 are now actually in the provider and an issue with cloning Blake2b digests has been fixed.</li>
<li>PKCS#5 Scheme 2 using DESede CBC is now supported by the PKCS#12 implementation.</li>
<li>The IES engine would sometimes throw a "too short" exception on small messages which were the right length. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Cipher.getOutputSize() for IES ciphers would throw a ClassCastException. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>It turns out, after advice one way and another that the NESSIE test vectors for Serpent are now what should be followed and that the vectors in the AES submission are regarded as an algorithm called Tnepres. The Serpent version now follows the NESSIE vectors, and the Tnepres cipher has been added to the provider and the lightweight API for compatibility.</li>
<li>Problems with DTLS record-layer version handling were resolved, making version negotiation work properly.
</ul>
<h3>2.29.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Camellia and SEED key wrapping are now supported for CMS key agreement</li>
<li>The BC TLS/DTLS code now includes a non-blocking API.</li>
<li>CTR/SIC mode now support an internal counter. The internal counter can be turned on by passing an IV smaller than the block size of the cipher's algorithm.</li>
<li>The lightweight CMS API operators now support CAST5 and RC2 CBC encryption.</li>
<li>The CMS API now supports Diffie-Hellman as specified in RFC 3370.</li>
<li>Support has been added to the CMS API for PKCS#7 ANY type encapsulated content where the encapsulated content is not an OCTET STRING.</li>
<li>PSSSigner in the lightweight API now supports fixed salts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.29.4 Security Advisory</h3>
<ul>
<li>(D)TLS 1.2: Motivated by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=CVE-2015-7575">CVE-2015-7575</a>, we have added validation that the signature algorithm received in DigitallySigned structures is actually one of those offered (in signature_algorithms extension or CertificateRequest). With our default TLS configuration, we do not believe there is an exploitable vulnerability in any earlier releases. Users that are customizing the signature_algorithms extension, or running a server supporting client authentication, are advised to double-check that they are not offering any signature algorithms involving MD5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.29.5 Notes</h3>
<p>
If you have been using Serpent, you will need to either change to Tnepres, or take into account the fact that Serpent is now byte-swapped compared to what it was before.

<a id="r1rv53"><h3>2.30.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.53 <br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2015, October 10

<ul>
<li>The BC JCE cipher implementations could sometimes fail when used in conjunction with the JSSE and NIO. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>PGPPublicKey.getBitStrength() always returned 0 for EC keys. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>A PKCS12 key store containing a looping certificate chain could cause an OutOfMemoryException. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>A change in JDK 1.8 meant that X509Certificate.verify(PublicKey, Provider) would cause a stack overflow. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Nested multiparts with irregular post-amble could cause verification issues for the SMIMESigned classes. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>CMSSignedData now supports verification of signed attributes where the calculated digest uses a different algorithm from the digest used in the signature.</li>
<li>TRUSTED CERTIFICATE parsing in PEM files was ignoring the attribute block. A new class X509TrustedCertificateBlock is now returned containing both the certificate and the trust information.</li>
<li>Adding a password to a PGP key which did not previously have one would result in an improperly formatted key. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>ECIES/IES was only using a 4 byte label length for the MAC tag when it should have been an 8 byte one. This has now been fixed and OldECIES/OldIES has been added for backwards compatibility.</li>
<li>The JceCRMFEncryptorBuilder was not recognising key size specific object identifiers properly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The OpenPGP ClearSignedFileProcessor would not handle verification of single line files properly. This has been fixed.</li>

<li>PGP signature hashed sub-packets with long length encodings would fail to validate on signature checking. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The S/MIME API would occasionally leak InputStreams which could cause issues with custom DataSource implementations. This has been fixed.</li>

<li>A bug in the DirectKeySignature OpenPGP example which could lead to extra data appearing in the signature has been fixed.</li>
<li>Explicit configuration of a BcAsymmetricKeyWrapper with a SecureRandom was not properly propagated internally. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>A CRL with a null certificate issuer would sometimes result in a NullPointerException during CertPathProcessing. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The CertPath processor would occasionally fail to match a DistributionPoint name correctly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>In order to avoid confusion about thread safety, BCrypt now uses a new instance for hash calculation every time it is invoked.</li>
<li>Some decidedly odd argument casting in the PKIXCertPathValidator has been fixed to throw an InvalidAlgorithmParameterException.</li>
<li>Presenting an empty array of certificates to the PKIXCertPathValidator would cause an IndexOutOfRangeException instead of a CertPathValidatorException. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.30.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to specify that an unwrapped key must be usable by a software provider in the asymmetric unwrappers for CMS.</li>
<li>A Blake2b implementation has been added to the provider and lightweight API.</li>

<li>EC ContentSigners and EC ContentVerifiers have been added to the lightweight operator package in the PKIX APIs.</li>
<li>The PKCS#12 key store will now garbage collect orphaned certificates on saving.</li>
<li>Caching for ASN.1 ObjectIdentifiers has been rewritten to make use of an intern method. The "usual suspects" are now interned automatically, and the cache is used by the parser. Other OIDs can be added to the cache by calling ASN1ObjectIdentifier.intern().</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.30.4 Notes</h3>
<p>
It turns out there was a similar, but different, issue in Crypto++ to the BC issue with ECIES. Crypto++ 6.0 now offers a corrected version of ECIES which is compatible with that which is now in BC.
</p>

Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2013, December 3
<h3>2.33.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The DualECSP800DRBG sometimes truncated the last block in the generated stream incorrectly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Keys produced from RSA certificates with specialised parameters would lose the parameter settings. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>OAEP parameters were being ignored on CMS key trans recipient processing. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>OpenPGP NotationData was restricting the name and value lengths to 255 characters and truncating silently. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>CTS mode is now in alignment with the errata for RFC 2040, as detailed in RFC 3962.</li>
<li>Occasionally the provider implementation of DH KeyAgreement would drop a leading zero byte off the start of the shared secret (see RFC 2631 2.1.2). This has been fixed.</li>
<li>RFC3394WrapEngine was ignoring the offset parameter inOff and using zero instead. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>GOST keys would not encode using the CryptoPro parameter set, even if it was available. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>The TimeStampRequest stream constructor was not setting the extensions field correctly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Default RC2 parameters for 40 bit RC2 keys in CMSEnvelopedData were encoding incorrectly. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>In case of a long hash the DSTU4145 implementation would sometimes remove one bit too much during truncation. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.33.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>

<h3>2.34.4 Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The NTRU implementation has been moved into the org.bouncycastle.pqc package hierarchy.</li>

<h3>2.36.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>OpenPGP ID based certifications now support UTF-8.

</ul>

<h3>2.36.4 Other notes</h3>
<p>
Okay, so we have had to do another release. The issue we have run into is that we probably didn't go far enough in 1.46, but we are now confident that moving from this release to 2.0 should be largely just getting rid of deprecated methods. While this release does change a lot it is relatively straight forward to do a port and we have a <a href="https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/wiki/Porting-From-Earlier-BC-Releases-to-1.47-and-Later">porting guide</a> which explains the important ones. The area there has been the most change in is the ASN.1 library which was in bad need of a rewrite after 10 years of patching. On the bright side the rewrite did allow us to eliminate a few problems and bugs in the ASN.1 library, so we have some hope anyone porting to it will also have similar benefits. As with 1.46 the other point of emphasis has been making sure interface support is available for operations across the major APIs, so the lightweight API or some local role your own methods can be used instead for doing encryption and signing.
</p>

<a id="r1rv46"><h3>2.37.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.46<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2011, February 23

</ul>
<h3>2.37.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>A null genTime can be passed to TimeStampResponseGenerator.generate() to generate timeNotAvailable error responses.</li>
<li>Support has been added for reading and writing of openssl PKCS#8 encrypted keys.</li>
<li>New streams have been added for supporting general creation of PEM data, and allowing for estimation of output size on generation. Generators have been added for some of the standard OpenSSL objects.</li>
<li>CRL searching for CertPath validation now supports the optional algorithm given in Section 6.3.3 of RFC 5280, allowing the latest CRL to be used for a set time providing the certificate is unexpired.</li>

</ul>
<h3>2.37.4 Other notes</h3>
<p>
Baring security patches we expect 1.46 will be the last of the 1.* releases. The next release of
BC will be version 2.0. For this reason a lot of things in 1.46 that relate to CMS have been deprecated and
new methods have been added to the CMS and certificate handling APIs which provide greater flexibility
in how digest and signature algorithms get used. It is now possible to use the lightweight API or a simple
custom API with CMS and for certificate generation. In addition a lot of methods and some classes that were
deprecated for reasons of been confusing, or in some cases just plan wrong, have been removed. 
</p>
<p>
So there are four things useful to know about this release:
<ul>
<li>It's not a simple drop in like previous releases, if you wish migrate to it you will need to recompile your application.</li>
<li>If you avoid deprecated methods it should be relatively painless to move to version 2.0</li>
<li>The X509Name class will utlimately be replacde with the X500Name class, the getInstance() methods on both these classes allow conversion from one type to another.</li>
<li>The org.bouncycastle.cms.RecipientId class now has a collection of subclasses to allow for more specific recipient matching. If you are creating your own recipient ids you should use the constructors for the subclasses rather than relying on the set methods inherited from X509CertSelector. The dependencies on X509CertSelector and CertStore will be removed from the version 2 CMS API.</li>
</ul>

<li>Occasional uses of "private final" on methods were causing issues with some J2ME platforms. The use of "private final" on methods has been removed.</li>
<li>NONEwithDSA was not resetting correctly on verify() or sign(). This has been fixed.</li>

<li>Generic sorting now takes place in the CertificateFactory.generateCertPath() rather than CertPathValidator.
<li>DERGeneralizedTime can now handle time strings with milli-seconds.
<li>Stateful CertPathCheckers were not being initialised in all cases, by the CertPathValidator. This has been fixed.

<li>The provider and the light weight API now support the WHIRLPOOL message digest.
</ul>
<h3>2.55.4 Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patches for S/MIME binary signatures and canonicalization were actually applied in 1.27, but a couple of days after the release - if the class 
CMSProcessableBodyPartOutbound is present in the package org.bouncycastle.mail.smime you have the patched 1.27. We would recommend upgrading to 1.28 in any case
as some S/MIME 3.1 recommendations have also been introduced for header creation.
<li>GOST private keys are probably not encoding correctly and can be expected to change.
</ul>

    <li>A CertPath implementation that runs under jdk1.1 and jdk1.4 has also
    being contributed. A work around to allow it to be used with jdk1.2 and
    jdk1.3 has also been added. Note: the implementation is not quite complete
    because policymapping, name and subtree constraints are not yet
    implemented.
    <li>The API now supports the generation of PKCS7 signed objects. Note: this
    is still beta code - one known issue is that it doesn't support single
    length certificate chains for signing keys.
</ul>

<a id="r1rv12"><h3>2.71.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.12<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2002, February 8
<h3>2.71.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The ASN.1 library was unable to read an empty set object. This has been fixed.
    <li>Returning sets of critical and non-critical extensions on X.509 certificates could result in a null pointer exception if the certificate had no extensions. This has been fixed.
    <li>The BC JKS implementation does not follow the conventional one - it has been renamed BKS, an attempt to create a JKS keystore using the BC provider will now result in an exception.
    <li>The PKCS 10 generator verify(provider) method was ignoring the provider when generating the public key. This has been fixed.
    <li>The PKCS12 store would throw an OutOfMemoryException if passed a non-PKCS12 file. This has been fixed.
    <li>In the case where there was no AuthorityKeyIdentifier the PKCS12 store
    would fail to find certificates further up the signing chain. The store now
    uses the IssuerDN if no AuthorityKeyIdentifier is specified and the IssuerDN
    is different from the SubjectDN,
    <li>PKCS10/CertificationRequestInfo objects with only a single attribute wer
    not being handled properly. This has been fixed.
    <li>getExtensionValue for X.509 CRLs was returning the value of the
    DER-Encoded octet string not the DER-Encoded octet string as required. This
    has been fixed.
    <li>the IV algorithm parameters class would improperly throw an exception
    on initialisation. This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.71.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The AESWrap ciphers will now take IV's.
    <li>The DES-EDEWrap algorithm described in https://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-smime-key-wrap-01.txt is now supported.
    <li>Support for the ExtendedKeyUsageExtension and the KeyPurposeId has been added.
    <li>The OID based alias for DSA has been added to the JCE provider.
    <li>BC key stores now implement the BCKeyStore interface so you can provide your own source of randomness to a key store.
    <li>The ASN.1 library now supports GeneralizedTime.
    <li>HMACSHA256, HMACSHA384, and HMACSHA512 are now added.
    <li>PSS has been added to the JCE, PSS and ISO9796 signers in the lightweight api have been rewritten so they can be used incrementally. SHA256withRSA, SHA384withRSA, and SHA512withRSA have been added.
    <li>Base support for CMS (RFC 2630) is now provided (see CONTRIBUTORS file
    for details).
</ul>

<a id="r1rv11"><h3>2.72.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.11<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, December 10
<h3>2.72.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>X9.23 padding of MACs now works correctly with block size aligned data.
<li>Loading a corrupted "UBER" key store would occasionally cause the
appearance of hanging. This has been fixed.
<li>Loading a PKCS12 store where not all certificates had PKCS9 attributes
assigned to them would cause a NullPointerException. This has been fixed.
<li>The PKCS12 store wasn't correctly recovering certificate chains of
length less than 2 on calling the getCertificateChain method. This has been
fixed.
<li>Lone certificates were not been stored in the PKCS12 store. This has been fixed.
<li>CFB and OFB modes weren't padding iv's more than 1 byte less than the 
block size of the cipher if the mode was reused with a shorter IV. This has
been fixed.
<li>IV handling and block size return values for CFB and OFB modes wasn't being handled in the same way as the Sun reference implementation. This has been fixed.
<li>CertificateInfoRequests were not handling null attributes correctly. This
has been fixed.
<li>Tags for the X.509 GeneralName structure were wrongly encoded. This has been
fixed.
<li>getExtensionValue for X.509 certificates was returning the value of the
DER-Encoded octet string not the DER-Encoded octet string as required. This has
been fixed.
<li>reset on the version 3 X.509 certificate generator was not flushing the
extensions. This has been fixed.
<li>The NetscapeCert type bits were reversed! This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.72.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>The lightweight API and the JCE provider now support ElGamal.
<li>X509Principal, and X509Name now supports the "DC" attribute and the
creation of directory names from vectors.
<li>RSA-PSS signature padding has been added to the lightweight API.
<li>EC Public/Private keys are now encoded in accordance with SEC 1. The library
will still read older keys as well.
<li>Added PKCS12-DEF a pkcs12 based key store which works around a bug in
the Sun keytool - it always uses the default provider for creating certificates.
<li>A cut down version of the Rijndael has been added that provides the functionality required to conform the the AES. It is designed to fully support FIPS-197. A fips AES wrapper (AESWrap in the JCE, AESWrapEngine in the lightweight library has also been added).
<li>Elliptic curve routines now handle uncompressed points as well as the
compressed ones.
</ul>
<h3>2.72.4 Other changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>As the range of public key types supported has expanded the getPublicKey
method on the SubjectPublicKeyInfo class is not always going to work. The
more generic method getPublicKeyData has been added and getPublicKey now
throws an IOException if there is a problem.
</ul>

<a id="r1rv10"><h3>2.73.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.10<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, October 20
<h3>2.73.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The PKCS12 Key Store now interoperates with the JDK key tool. <b>Note:</b> this does mean the the key name passed to the setKeyEntry calls has become
significant.
<li>The "int" constructor for DERInteger only supported ints up to 128. This
has been fixed.
<li>The ASN.1 input streams now handle zero-tagged zero length objects correctly.
</ul>
<h3>2.73.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>The JCE Provider and the lightweight API now support Serpent, CAST5, and CAST6.
<li>The JCE provider and the lightweight API now has an implementation of ECIES.
<b>Note:</b> this is based on a draft, don't use it for anything that needs to
be kept long term as it may be adjusted.
<li>Further work has been done on performance - mainly in the symmetric ciphers.
<li>Support for the generation of PKCS10 certification requests has been added.
</ul>

<a id="r1rv09"><h3>2.74.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.09<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, October 6
<h3>2.74.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>failure to pass in an RC5 parameters object now results in an exception
at the upper level of the JCE, rather than falling over in the lightweight
library.
<li>ISO10126Padding now incorporates the correct amount of random data.
<li>The PKCS12 key store wasn't picking up certificate chains properly
when being used to write PKCS12 files. This has been fixed.
<li>The Twofish engine would call System.exit if the key was too large.
This has been fixed.
<li>In some cases the ASN.1 library wouldn't handle implicit tagging properly.
This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.74.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for RC5-64 has been added to the JCE.
<li>ISO9796-2 signatures have been added to the JCE and lightweight API.
<li>A more general paddings packge for use with MACs and block ciphers had been aded to the lightweight API. MACs now allow you to specify padding.
<li>X9.23 Padding has been added to the JCE and lightwieght API. The old
PaddedBlockCipher class is now deprecated see org.bouncycastle.crypto.paddings for details.
<li>SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 are now added. Note: while the public review
period has finished, these algorithms have not yet been standardised, in the
event that final standardisation changes the algorithms these implementations
will be changed.
<li>It's now possible to set bag attributes on items to go into a PKCS12 store,
using the org.bouncycastle.jce.interfaces.PKCS12BagAttributeCarrier interface.
<li>More classses have been added to the ASN.1 package for dealing with
certificate extensions and CRLs including a CRL generator. Note: the
CRL generators should be regarded as under development and subject to change.
<li>There's now an examples package for the JCE (in addition to the examples
in org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.test) - org.bouncycastle.jce.examples. It
currently consists of a class showing how to generate a PKCS12 file.
<li>The X.509 CertificateFactory now includes CRL support.  DER or PEM CRLs may be processed.
<li>The BigInteger library has been written with a view to making it less
resource hungry and faster - whether it's fast enough remains to be seen!
</ul>

<a id="r1rv08"><h3>2.75.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.08<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, September 9
<h3>2.75.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>It wasn't possible to specify an ordering for distinguished names in
X509 certificates. This is now supported.
<li>In some circumstances stream Ciphers in the JCE would cause null pointer
exceptions on doFinal. This has been fixed.
<li>Unpadded ciphers would sometimes buffer the last block of input, even
if it could be processed. This has been fixed.
<li>The netscape certificate request class wouldn't compile under JDK 1.1. This
has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.75.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>ISO 9796-1 padding is now supported with RSA in the lightweight
API and the JCE.
<li>support classes have been added for reading and writing PKCS 12 files,
including a keystore for the JCA.
<li>The message digests MD4, Tiger, and RIPEMD128 have been added to the
JCE and the lightweight API. Note: MD4 and RIPEMD128 have been added for
compatibility purposes only - we recommend you don't use them for anything new!
<li>The JDK 1.1 certificate classes didn't conform to the JDK 1.2 API as
the collections class was not present. Thanks to a donated collections API
this is fixed.
</ul>

<a id="r1rv07"><h3>2.76.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.07<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, July 9
<h3>2.76.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>It turned out that the setOddParity method in the DESParameter class
was indeed doing something odd but not what was intended. This is now
fixed. <b>Note:</b>This will affect some PBE encryptions that were carried
out with DES, equivalent PBE ciphers to the old PBE DES cipher can be
accessed by prepending the work "Broken" in front of the original PBE cipher
call. If you want an example of how to deal with this as a migration issue
have a look in org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JDKKeyStore lines 201-291.
</ul>

<a id="r1rv06"><h3>2.77.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.06<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, July 2
<h3>2.77.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Diffie-Hellman keys are now properly serialisable as well as
encodable.
<li>Three of the semi-weak keys in the DESParameters, and the DESKeySpec look
up table, were incorrect. This has been fixed.
<li>DESEDE key generators now accept 112 and 168 as the key sizes, as well
as 128 and 192 (for those people who don't like to count the parity bits).
<li>Providing no strength parameter is passed to the DESede key generator in
the JCE provider, the provider now generates DESede keys in the k1-k2-k1
format (which is compatible with the Sun reference implementation), otherwise
you get what you ask for (3-DES or 2-DES in the minimum number of bytes).
<li>Base Diffie-Hellman key agreement now works correctly for more than two
parties.
<li>Cipher.getAlgorithmParameters was returing null in cases where a cipher
object had generated it's own IV. This has been fixed.
<li>An error in the key store occasionally caused checks of entry types to
result in a null pointer exception. This has been fixed.
<li>RSA key generator in JCE now recognises RSAKeyGenerationParameterSpec.
<li>Resetting and resusing HMacs in the lightweight and heavyweight libraries
caused a NullPointer exception. This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.77.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>ISO10126Padding is now recognised explicitly for block ciphers
as well.
<li>The Blowfish implementation is now somewhat faster.
</ul>

<a id="r1rv05"><h3>2.78.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.05<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, April 17
<h3>2.78.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The DESEDE key generator can now be used to generate 2-Key-DESEDE
keys as well as 3-Key-DESEDE keys.
<li>One of the weak keys in the DESParameters, and the DESKeySpec look
up table, was incorrect. This has been fixed.
<li>The PKCS12 generator was only generating the first 128-160 bits of the
key correctly (depending on the digest used). This has been fixed.
<li>The ASN.1 library was skipping explicitly tagged objects of zero length.
This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.78.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is now an org.bouncycastle.jce.netscape package which has
a class in for dealing with Netscape Certificate Request objects.
</ul>
<h3>2.78.4 Additional Notes</h3>
<p>
Concerning the PKCS12 fix: in a few cases this may cause some backward
compatibility issues - if this happens to you, drop us a line at
<a href="mailto:feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org">feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org</a>
and we will help you get it sorted out.
</p>
<a id="r1rv04"><h3>2.79.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.04<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, March 11
<h3>2.79.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Signatures generated by other providers that include optional null
parameters in the AlgorithmIdentifier are now handled correctly by the
provider.
<li>The JCE 1.2.1 states that the names of algorithms associated with the JCE
are case insensitive. The class that matches algorithms to names now tries
to match the name given with it's equivalent in upper case, before trying
to match it as given. If you write a provider and include versions of your
algorithm names in uppercase only, this JCE implementation will always
match a getInstance regardless of the case of the algorithm passed into
the getInstance method.
<li>If the JCE API and the Provider were in a different class path, the
class loader being used sometimes failed to find classes for JCE Ciphers, etc.
This has been fixed.
<li>An error in the ASN.1 library was causing problems serialising Diffie-Hellman keys. This has been fixed.
<li>The agreement package was left out of the j2me bat file. This has been fixed.
<li>The BigInteger class for 1.0 and the j2me wasn't able to generate random
integers (prime or otherwise). This has been fixed. 
<li>The BigInteger class would sometimes go into a death spiral if the any
32nd bit of an exponent was set when modPow was called. This has been fixed. 
<li>Cipher.getInstance would treat "//" in a transformation as a single "/".
This has been fixed.
<li>PBEWithSHAAndIDEA-CBC was throwing an exception on initialisation. This has
been fixed.
<li>The X509Name class in the asn1.x509 package wasn't initialising its local
hash table when the hash table constructor was called. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.79.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added Elliptic Curve DSA (X9.62) - ECDSA - to provider and lightweight
library.
<li>Added Elliptic Curve basic Diffie-Hellman to provider and lightweight
library.
<li>Added DSA support to the provider and the lightweight library.
<li>Added super class interfaces for basic Diffie-Hellman agreement classes
to lightweight library.
<li>The certificate generators now support ECDSA and DSA certs as well.
</ul>

<a id="r1rv03"><h3>2.80.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.03<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2001, January 7
<h3>2.80.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>CFB and OFB modes when specified without padding would insist on input
being block aligned. When specified without padding CFB and OFB now behave in a compatible 
fashion (a doFinal on a partial block will yield just the data that could
be processed).
In short, it provides another way of generating cipher text the same
length as the plain text.
</ul>

<a id="r1rv02"><h3>2.81.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.02<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000, November 7
<h3>2.81.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RSA key pair generator occasionally produced keys 1 bit under the
requested size. This is now fixed.
</ul>

<a id="r1rv01"><h3>2.82.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.01<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000, October 15
<h3>2.82.2 Defects Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Buffered ciphers in lightweight library were not resetting correctly
on a doFinal. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<a id="r1rv00"><h3>2.83.1 Version</h3></a>
Release: 1.00<br/>
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000, October 13
<h3>2.83.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>JDK1.2 version now works with keytool for certificate generation.
<li>Certificate toString method no longer throws a null pointer exception
if a group [3] extension has not been added.
<li>Under some circumstances the NullCipher would throw a NullPointerException,
this has been fixed.
<li>Under some circumstances CipherInputStream would throw a NullPointerException, this has been fixed.
<li>OpenSSL/SSLeay private key encodings would cause an exception to be thrown
by the RSA key factory. This is now fixed.
<li>The Cipher class always used the default provider even when one was specified, this has been fixed.
<li>Some DES PBE algorithms did not set the parity correctly in generated keys, this has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.83.3 Additional functionality</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Argument validation is much improved.
<li>An X509KeyUsage class has been added to the JCE class to make it easier
to specify the KeyUsage extension on X.509 certificates.
<li>The library now allows creation of version 1 certificates as well.
</ul>

<h3>3.0 Notes</h3>
<p>
The J2ME is only supported under Windows.
<p>
If you are trying to use the lightweight provider in a JDK 1.0 applet, you
need to change the package names for java.math.BigInteger, java.lang.IllegalStateException, and java.security.SecureRandom
<p>
The RSA test under JDK 1.0 and J2ME takes a while to run...
