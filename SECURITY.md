# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think that you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to this email address: [feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org](mailto:feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org)

Describe the issue including all details, for example: 
* Short summary of the problem
* Steps to reproduce
* Affected API versions
* Logs if available 

The Bouncy Castle team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. You may be asked to provide additional information or guidance. 

If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory and acknowledge your contributions as part of it. Optionally, you can have your name and contact information listed in [Contributors](https://www.bouncycastle.org/contributors.html) as well. 

Please note we endeavor to issue patched releases that deal with security issues as soon as they are made known to us, ideally prior to issuing a Security Advisory where otherwise possible. In some cases, particularly if it relates to a FIPS release, delays due to external processes may delay the issuing of a Security Advisory.
