 * <p>
 * For example, if the cipher is initialized for encryption, the CipherOutputStream will encrypt the
 * data before writing the encrypted data to the underlying stream.

 * This is a reimplementation of {@link javax.crypto.CipherOutputStream} that is safe for use with
 * AEAD block ciphers, and does not silently catch {@link BadPaddingException} and
 * {@link IllegalBlockSizeException} errors. Any errors that occur during {@link Cipher#doFinal()
