/**
 * A CipherInputStream is composed of an InputStream and a cipher so that read() methods return data
 * that are read in from the underlying InputStream but have been additionally processed by the
 * Cipher. The cipher must be fully initialized before being used by a CipherInputStream.
 * <p>
 * For example, if the Cipher is initialized for decryption, the CipherInputStream will attempt to
 * read in data and decrypt them, before returning the decrypted data.
 * <p>
 * This is a reimplementation of {@link javax.crypto.CipherInputStream} that is safe for use with
 * AEAD block ciphers, and does not silently catch {@link BadPaddingException} and
 * {@link IllegalBlockSizeException} errors. Any errors that occur during {@link Cipher#doFinal()
 * finalisation} are rethrown wrapped in an {@link InvalidCipherTextIOException}.
