 * RFC 9147 5.8.4 and 7. The owner of everything that happens on a DTLS 1.3 connection after the handshake has
 * completed: the post-handshake handshake messages, their reassembly, and the acknowledgements in both
 * directions.
 * <p>
 * The reliable handshake's own state - its flight tracker, its reassemblers, its ACK list - is scoped to a
 * flight and dies with {@link DTLSReliableHandshake#finish()}, which is why that method used to unregister the
 * record layer's ACK listener outright. This class is what it is handed to instead, and unlike the RFC 9147
 * 5.8.1 final-flight hook it is not bounded by the retransmit timeout: a KeyUpdate may arrive at any point in
 * a connection's life, so the owner lives as long as the connection does.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * RFC 9147 5.8.4 describes the sending side as "independent state machines", one per message category, each
 * reducing to "waiting for an ACK and retransmitting the original message". The receiving side, implemented
 * here, is common to all of them: reassemble, dispatch by message type, acknowledge the record.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread safety: a send thread reaches this class through {@code checkKeyUpdateBeforeSend} while a receive
 * thread reaches it through the ACK listener, the record dispatch and the timers, so every non-private method
 * is synchronized on this object. LOCK ORDER: this monitor is taken FIRST and the record layer's write lock
 * second, because the work done here calls back into the record layer. A call into this class from inside a
 * {@code synchronized (writeLock)} block would take the two in the opposite order and can deadlock; see the
 * note on that field.

     * its next Application Data record". RFC 9147 5.8.4: an implementation MUST NOT send a KeyUpdate "if an

     * arrives while our own KeyUpdate is outstanding, honouring 8446 means breaking 9147, and the only way to
     * break neither is to stop sending application data until the outstanding update clears. So 9147 is
     * followed: the obligation is DEFERRED past application data - the latch above holds it - and discharged
     * on the first send after the outstanding KeyUpdate has been acknowledged.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * 9147 wins on three grounds. It is the DTLS specification constraining a TLS rule it inherits. Its rule
     * is load-bearing: only two epoch bits are on the wire (RFC 9147 4.2.2), so a second unacknowledged
     * KeyUpdate makes the receiver's epoch reconstruction ambiguous, whereas 8446's rule is timeliness
     * hygiene - the answer is late, not absent. And the third option, blocking application data until the
     * outstanding update clears, would be a self-inflicted stall on the data path in response to a
     * peer-controlled message. The deferral is bounded by our own retransmit state machine (5.8.4), which is
     * already driving that KeyUpdate to an acknowledgement.
     * </p>
     * The record this was called for is unaffected: it still goes out at the current write epoch, because
     * section 8 will not let the write epoch move until the KeyUpdate is acknowledged.
