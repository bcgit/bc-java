    /*
     * RFC 9147 8. True for an epoch built from the PEER's updated traffic secret, i.e. one created by
     * DTLSRecordLayer.updatePeerReadEpoch. Such an epoch can be read at and must never be written at.
     *
     * Not because writing at it would use the peer's key - it would not. TlsUtils.initCipher builds a cipher
     * for BOTH directions: TlsAEADCipher's (D)TLS 1.3 constructor calls rekeyCipher once for the decrypt side,
     * keyed from the peer's traffic secret, and once for the encrypt side, keyed from the LOCAL one.
     * updatePeerReadEpoch updates only the peer's secret (TlsUtils.update13TrafficSecretPeer), so the epoch it
     * builds carries an encrypt side keyed from the LOCAL secret's current value, paired with a sequence
     * number counter of its own that starts at zero.
     *
     * Which epoch that key belongs to depends on when the derivation happens. Normally it is the current write
     * epoch's key. If a KeyUpdate of ours is already outstanding it is the PENDING write epoch's, because
     * deriveNextWriteEpoch advances the local secret when the KeyUpdate is sent and installPendingWriteEpoch
     * only swaps the epoch in when the ACK arrives. Either way it is a key that is live, or about to be.
     *
     * So allocating a record from this epoch would not produce something the peer cannot read. It would
     * produce records encrypted under the SAME AEAD key as another epoch, at nonces that epoch either has
     * already used or will use, because both counters start at zero. That is AEAD nonce reuse: silent, with
     * the connection still working, and for GCM it is enough to recover the authentication key. It is the
     * worst outcome an epoch lookup can have, and nothing observable would report it.
     *
     * The structural cause, which is why this flag has to exist at all: updatePeerReadEpoch builds a full
     * bidirectional cipher when it needs only the read direction, and so leaves a correctly-keyed encryptor in
     * an object that must never encrypt.
     *
     * Every other epoch this record layer holds is one both directions shared (the handshake installs one
     * epoch for both) or one of our own making, and each of those is legitimately writable.
