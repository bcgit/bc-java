/**
 * A KEM (key encapsulation mechanism) is a set of functions that can be used to obtain
 * a symmetric encryption key from asymmetric keys.
 * The term KEM is a generalisation of Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
 * The KEM abstraction can also be used to obtain quantumly exchanged keys via QKD
 * (a KEM then needs to exchange only key IDs)
 * <p>
 * The three KEM functions actually define a half-KEM: keyGen() and decapsulate() are called at one side (e.g., the client),
 * while encapsulate() is called at the other side (e.g., the server).
 * <p>
 * This interface defines the three functions that are present in any KEM.
 * All keys/secrets/ciphertexts are byte[]-encoded.
