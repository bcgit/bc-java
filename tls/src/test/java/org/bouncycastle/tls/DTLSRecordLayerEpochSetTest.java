 * epochs, walked most recent first by {@code getLiveReadEpoch(int)}, and writes at an epoch through the same
 * walk. {@code getLiveReadEpochs()} is a view over that walk for tests; the record path does not use it.
 * <p>
 * The load-bearing test here is {@link #testAliasingEpochResolvesToTheMostRecentMatch()}: only the low 2
 * epoch bits are on the wire, so two live epochs can alias, and the RFC resolves that to the most recent of
